Emud ver 2.3 (Updated by Scandum - December 2002)
==============================================================================

Word from me (Scandum)

    This document was originally written by Chaos and Order for Mortal Realms.
    Emud, a clone of mortal realms, is still for 90% compatible with the
    source this document was written for.  So except for a couple of changes
    this guide is an exact duplicate of the MrMud 1.4 builder document.
    It should be significantly accurater than the original version though.
    (At least, so I hope)

Greetings future area creator!

    We (Chaos and me, Order) have put together this collection of documents as
    both references and instructions to building areas.  Below is a list of the
    documents in the order which we recommend reading, along with a brief
    description of each.

diku_bld.txt

    The official handbook for creating Diku areas as created by the
    Curious Area Workshop, it is included in the Emud Area Package because
    it does a decent job of describing all of the basics of area building.
    This document has been modified to the Emud configuration.

mob_prog.txt

    The instruction document that describes how to implement mob programs.
    This does NOT describe how to make special programs in C for mobiles,
    but details the functions and triggers used in programming mobiles from
    the area file.  This is the only method of support that can be given
    to creators for making mobiles do special functions.

emud.txt
    the latest set of values used by Emud.  Updates to this document set will
    be contained in this file and the online builder help file.

spells.txt

    the list of spells and the numbers necessary for specifying the spells in
    creating scrolls, potions, pills, scrolls staffs, wands and mobile progs.

holygrove.are

    An example area, with mobile programs.

Don't be afraid to create, Scandum, the Dude of Fire

==============================================================================

Emud now uses OLC which I believe to be short for Online Creation. This means
you can create your entire area online using a build char on the test mud.
If you wish you can skip most sections, and only pay attention to the part
describing object and mobile programs. If you want more information you can
read it all, it might come in handy when you know what you're doing, and
should make using the OLC engine a little easier.

Also there is a help file online on the test mud, type: help builder, and
you will enter it.

1.  Overview

    This document is meant to be a basic tutorial to building areas for Emud.
    Readers of this Handbook should have at least have some experience with
    Emud or Diku muds, and will understand the basic concepts of armor, levels,
    and the et cetera.

    Nowadays, many mud-admins express the wish to have an entirely unique world.
    Unfortunately, building is time consuming and requires no mean amount of
    skill, with the added 'bonus' of being hard to learn; the standard mud-docs
    that get bandied about are somewhat vague on certain subjects, and were
    originally intended as a reference guide rather than a learning document.
    I hope to make this Handbook a 'cookbook' of sorts -- an explanation of the
    how's and what's of building a Emud based area for the non-coding inclined.

    This document is a tutorial for building in the standard Emud release 2.2.
    Most (95% or so) muds have changed or added to the information, but still
    follow the basic format.  Reading this document should prepare you for most
    Diku muds you will encounter out on the net.

    The Curious Area Workshops highly recommends that every builder understands
    the nuts and bolts of building, even if they have access to one of the
    mud-area editors available out there.  Being able to build with an editor
    is nice, but the knowledge of how the nuts and bolts of building actually
    works is of great value when things go wrong.  We cannot emphasize this
    enough, but we will attempt to refrain from preaching it in the rest of
    this document.



2. Terminology

Here are some common terms used in builing, and this handbook:

Desc:    Short for 'description'.
Db:      Database.  The files that make up the 'world' of a mud.
Flag:    A bit-vector that tells the mud that a particular monster,
         object, or room has a certain quality.
Mob:     Mobile.  A monster.
Obj:     Object.
Tilde:   This is a tilde: ~ .  It signifies the end of a line or
         a field in some of the database files.
Vnum:    An object, monster, or room's unique identification number.
         Stands for 'Virtual Number'.
Zone:    Used synonimously with 'area'.




3. Basics

For all examples, the area under creation will be known as 'handbook' or
'example area'.  It is assumed that the builder has access to some standard
type of text editor and knows how to use it.

*** FILES

For each area, one file must be created for inclusion into the dikumud's db:

  handbook.are

This file includes the various sections of:

  #AREA
  #HELPS
  #MOBILES
  #OBJECTS
  #ROOMS
  #SHOPS
  #RESETS


*** FLAGS

    Simply put, a flag tells the mud that there is something 'special' about a
    mob, room, or object.  In the sections below, lists of flags will be given
    with a number, a bitvector, next to it.  For example, here is the list of
    room flags that will appear below in the #ROOMS section:

ROOM_DARK           1
ROOM_NO_MOB         4
ROOM_INDOORS        8
ROOM_PRIVATE      512
ROOM_SAFE        1024
ROOM_SOLITARY    2048
ROOM_PET_SHOP    4096
ROOM_NO_RECALL   8192


    Now, for example, you are building a room.  Deciding that this room is a
    small section of tunnel, you would choose the flags:

DARK (1)  and  INDOORS (8)

    These numbers are the important part.  When the mud looks at the .wld file,
    it looks for _one_ number in a certain particular spot for each room's flags.
    Therefore, to give one room _two_ flags, you ADD the bitvectors together
    and place that number in the flags spot of that room's data.
    Thus for this example:

INDOORS + DARK = 9

    Another simple format can be each number separated by a '|' symbol.
    The '|' symbol is an logic OR symbol.

INDOORS + DARK = 1|8

    The final format is to use the names of the flags in replace of the
    numbers.  This system is MUCH easier to read, but may not be compatible
    with some of the mud-editors.

INDOORS + DARK = ROOM_INDOORS|ROOM_DARK


    How does this work, though?

    The bitvectors are in binary...the number you arrived at when you added
    can only be reached by one combination of adding those numbers together
    (you're not allowed to use a flag or number more than once).

    Thus, if your number was: 524 you would know that it was PRIVATE (512)
    (the highest number that will go into 522)

    522-512 = 10

    INDOORS (8) is the next highest number that will go into it.

    10-8 = 2

    NO_MOB (2) is the last one:  2-2 = 0  (no more flags).


    It should be obvious that the list is not complete.  The blank spots are
    flags the are not used but exist for backward compatiblity.  PLEASE do not
    use any of these.  The game may use some of them for temporary values, and
    their use may jeopardize the system.


*** Zone Number

    Each area must have its own unique number.  Usually, the imp of your
    particular mud will assign this to you.  This number is used as part
    of all your area's virtual numbers. (see below).

    The system that nearly all mud administrators like is the QQ format.
    This system places the symbols 'QQ' in replace of any zone number.  The
    administrators will later assign a number in replace of the QQs.


*** Virtual Numbers

    Every Mob, Obj and Room must have its own Virtual Number for the mud
    to identify it with.  Each number must be unique among its own type.

    For example, If I made the Sword of Cheezy Destruction, I may decide to
    make it item number 2200 of my zone.  The first two digits
    are the zone number (above) of my area, the second two identify which
    item it is in that area.

    These first two numbers will be assigned by the system administrators.
    The first two numbers should be replaced by 'QQ'.  Therefore the format
    you would write for the item number is QQ00.


    However, I can have a mobile with number 2200 as well.  A room #2200 too.
    The number must be unique among all others of its type (rooms, objs, mobs)
    But does not need to be unique in regards to other types of db's.

    Emud admins do not allow using any object or mobile that does not solely
    exist in the zone of the creator.  So all referenced objects or mobiles
    should start with the QQs.

    If your area has more than 100 rooms then continue using the 'QQ' method,
    but change the value to 'QR' for rooms 100-199, and 'QS' for rooms 200-299,
    etc...


*** Strings

    A string holds the actual data of the text sent to the player, such as a
    mobile's name, or a room description.  Strings can range in size from zero
    length to the MAX_STRING_LENGTH.  Emud systems are 20,000 bytes allowed per
    string in a description, and 2,000 for names and short descriptions.  All
    strings end in the tilde '~' symbol.  Placing a return after the text, but
    before the tilde will display the return to the player.

    Custom color may be added to certain strings.  Room descriptions, mobiles
    descriptions, object descriptions, and extra descriptions may all have
    custom color.  Adding color is as simple as adding a pair of matching 
    brackets, with three digits between them.  The three numbers are the
    parameters of the color change request.

    Format:    '{abc}'           with a,b,c being parameters.

    Parameter 'a':  VT102 code.
                       0 - Dim
                       1 - Bold
                       3 - Restore color to text default regardless of b,c
                       4 - Reverse
                       5 - Underline
                       7 - Flashing

    (All VT102 systems support Dim, Bold, and Restore)

    Parameter 'b':  Foreground color
    Parameter 'c':  Background color
                       0 - Black
                       1 - Red
                       2 - Green
                       3 - Yellow
                       4 - Blue
                       5 - Purple
                       6 - Cyan
                       7 - White

    Example:
    The small {130}dog{300} sits by the {114}cat{300}.~

    This example starts with normal colors.  'dog' is bold, yellow on black.
    The 'cat.' ends up being blue background, with red text.
    (be aware to reset after using a background color like in the example)


4.1  The #AREA section

    The #AREA section has very few lines but sets up the entire file.

*** Area Name

#AREA <area name>~

example: #AREA Sanitorium~


*** Author Name

#AUTHORS <author names>~

example: #AUTHORS Gregorius~


*** Reset Message

    This message will echo through the area every repop.

#RESETMSG <reset message>~

example: #RESETMSG <You hear the patter of little feet.~


***  Level Range

     This is a very arbitrary set of numbers that the creator must decide on.
     This field must contain exactly 4 numbers between 0 and 99

#RANGES <low_soft> <hi_soft> <low_hard> <hi_hard>

Example: #RANGES 40 60 1 95


*** Temperature (optional)

    This is the daily temperature scale in Fahrenheit.  The winter and summer
    lows are for night temperature, with the daily adding to it.  To reverse
    the seasons, simply switch out winter and summer temps.
    The 'Wetness Scale' is a number from 0 to 10.  0 is a desert.  10 is a
    tropical rain forest.  5 is the default value.
    Leaving this optional parameter off uses defualt settings for weather.

#TEMPERATURE <winter low> <summer low> <daily change> <wetness scale>

Example #TEMPRATURE 0 80 20 4


*** Flags (optional)

    These flags count for the entire area.

#FLAGS <area flags>

example: #FLAGS AFLAG_NORECALL|AFLAG_NOTELEPORT|AFLAG_NORIP
example: #FLAGS AFLAG_NOCASTLE|AFLAG_NOGOHOME|AFLAG_NODEBUG

AFLAG_NODEBUG

    Use this flag if you have rooms that are non-standard.  Usually this
    flag is not necessary.
    A non-standard room is one where when you leave room A north to room B.
    Then you leave room B south.  While trying to get to A, you actually
    end up at room C.

AFLAG_NOTELEPORT

    This stops a player from teleporting or rifting into the area.

AFLAG_NORECALL

    This stops a player from being able to use the recall spell in the area.

AFLAG_NORIP

    This stops a player from being able to cast the rip spell in the area.

AFLAG_NOCASTLE

    This stops a player from being able to build a castle in the area.

AFLAG_NOGOHOME

    This stops a player from being able to use the gohome command in the area.


4.2  The #HELPS section

    This section allows the addition of new help listings.
    Entire help menus may be created.

    Begin this section with:

#HELPS

    End this section with:

0 $~

***  Help Archetype

<level> <name list>~
<text of help and special menu pointers>
~

example:

5 SWORD CUTLASS "LONG SWORD"~
{300}
  The sword is a very strong weapon
  But you may find stronger ones.

  {120}(A) {050}Information on Knives
  {120}(B) {050}Information on Spoons

  {120}(-) {050}Return
{a}knife
{b}spoon
{-}cuttlery
~
*** Level

    This is the level the player must be to be able to read this help.
    Use 0 if you wish everyone to read it.

*** Name List

    This field is a list of keywords that will reference the help text.
    These may be odd encoded numbers for menu use only, or simple ones
    that the player may enter help on directly.
    This field should be in all capital letters.
    Use " " to cluster multiple words for a search string.

*** Body

    The body has several special encoded features.
    The first is that all initial spaces and returns are removed unless
    the body start with a '.' a color code works just as well though.

*** Menus

    The menu stucture shown above has two sections.  The first section, where
    the options are surrounded by '(' and ')' is the display section.
    The display section is shown with the rest of the body text.
    The actual decoded menu section is a line that starts with '{'.
    Once a menu option is trapped, the following letter is the option
    that the user must pick, followed by '}'.
    The following letters are what the menu item will reference in the
    help system.
    These menu items may point to any other item in the help db.
    Please use only lower case letters for the menu system, since this
    feature is case sensitive, and most people select menus by lower case.


4.3  The #ROOMS section

    The #ROOMS section contains all the information necessary for the
    mud to make all the rooms of your area, link the exits together, and
    all the other little things concerned with the 'where's' of an area.
    The file simply consists of all the rooms in sequential order by their
    virtual number.  Here is a sample room for this section's example:

    This section in the .are file will always start first with this line:

#ROOMS

    This section in the .are file will always end with with this line:

#0

*** ROOM ARCHETYPE

(the <'s and >'s are used to offset values, and should be ignored)


<#vnum>
<room name>~
<room description>~
<area number> <room flags> <sector type>

F <vnum to fall to> <slope of cliff> <amount of feet>

E

The First Room~
You are standing in the first room of this area.  Many rooms are sure to
follow, soon to be chock-filled with adventure, danger, romance, and Giant
Green Photosynthetic Death Gerbils from Morovia.
There is a sign hanging from the east wall here, and a large steel grate bars
the way to the north.

S

---example precedes this line---


  Now to explain what each part means, line by line:

#QQ00

  The virtual number of this room:
  Totally unique, no other room in the db will have this number after the
  adminstrators assign a value for the QQ.

The First Room~

  room name:
  the 'title' of the room.  This is typically not more than 5-6 words long.
  Note the tilde marking the end of this field.

You are standing .. the way to the north.
~
  room description:
  This is what a player sees if he or she types 'look' in that room.
  What is in this section is up to your own, personal taste.
  More about the various description types can be found below.
  Note the tilde marking the end of this field.

  Advise:
  Try to describe the room without telling the one reading it how they feel.
  Imagine yourself playing a vampire who according to the area creator:

  You feel shivers running down your spine as you see blood dripping down the
  wall.
  -or the other way around-
  You start to drool as you see delicous sparkling red blood dripping down
  the wall.

  Another advise would be not to describe the area as if the person walks
  through it from room A to Z, Venturing through some areas from room Z to A
  one gets the feeling they're walking backwards. as in:
  Before you leads a hallway northwards (while you just came in from the north)


QQ ROOM_INDOORS SECT_INSIDE

  The first number is the zone number of this room; what zone should
  the mud consider this room to be in for game purposes.  Please see
  'zone numbers' in section 3 of this handbook.

  The second number is the room flag value.  Please see 'flags' in
  section 3 of this handbook, and Room Flags below.

  The Third number is the sector type.  Please see 'sector types' below.

  Be aware the mud translates these flags to bitvectors, emud prefers
  their builders to use these flags instead of numbers. You can however
  use numbers, since it only takes a couple of seconds to convert them
  to flags with the proper tool.

DDIR_NORTH

  An exit to direction north.  The section on 'Exits' below will
  shed more light on this subject.

You spot the Second Room ...

  Exit description:
  What a player would see if they typed 'look north'.
  Note the tilde marking the end of this field.

grate steel~

  door name:
  What words can be used to manipulate the door.  These two words can be
  used in conjunction with open, close, pick, and look commands, etc.


1 QQ00 QQ01

  The first number is the door flag, 1 being: is_door
  This and the other numbers will be explained more fully under 'Exits' below.

  The second number is the key number. the virtual number of the object that
  can be used to lock or unlock this door.

  The third number is the vnum of what room this exit leads to.


E
  Tells the mud there is an extra description coming.

sign~

  extra name list:
  The words that can be used to look at the extra description.
  (i.e. 'look sign')  Note the tilde ending the field.

The sign says:...

  The text of the extra description.  Again, note the placement of the tilde.


S

  End-of-Room character.


Now, for more explanations...

*** DESCRIPTIONS

Descriptions are fairly self explanatory.

- Short Descriptions
  These are the short descriptions a player can see.
  They should be kept to half a line long.

  The short description of a room is mostly called: room name


- Descriptions
  These are the multi-line descriptions of rooms. When creating a description
  keep in mind to keep each line under 80 characters unless you use color
  codes. Clues to the Extra Descriptions should be included in the room
  description, if not elsewhere.


- Extra Descriptions

  An extra description, of which there can be many for each room, is
  something else specific to look at, not normally seen just by typing
  look, or entering the room.  An extra desc is started by an
  E  (a seperate E for each extra desc in the room),
  followed by the keywords that can be used to look at this description on
  the next line, each separated by a space, followed by a tilde.
  Then, the description itself, followed by a tilde.

E
keywords~
You spot the keywords.  They look important!
~


*** ROOM FLAGS

Please consult the section on flags in section 3 for how bitvectors are added
and used.  Briefly, add each flag that you want for a particular room.
Seperate them with the | (pipe) symbol.

ROOM_DARK                1

*** SECTOR TYPES

The 'sector type' of a room controls how many movement points it costs to
enter that room.  This is not a flag type item: choose one, and use the
value...

SECT_INSIDE                   0
SECT_CITY                     1
SECT_FIELD                    2    (allows castles to be build)
SECT_FOREST                   3    (allows castles to be build)
SECT_HILLS                    4    (allows castles to be build)
SECT_MOUNTAIN                 5    (allows castles to be build)
SECT_WATER_SWIM               6
SECT_WATER_NOSWIM             7    (Requires a boat)
SECT_UNUSED                   8
SECT_AIR                      9    (Requires fly spell)
SECT_DESERT                  10
SECT_LAVA                    11    (Requires Fire breath spell)
SECT_INN                     12    (Heals the player while not on the game)
SECT_ETHEREAL                13    (Requires Ethereal Travel spell)
SECT_ASTRAL                  14    (Requires Astral Projection spell)
SECT_UNDERWATER              15    (Requires Breath water spell)
SECT_LEY_LINES               16    (Something undefined...)

*** EXITS

Exits use the letter D and a number, compass, rather than the letter
abbreviations that most mudders are used to for compass directions.
Hence:
      (north)
         0                            4 (up)
         |                          /
(west) 3-+-1 (east)               +
         |                      /
         2                    5 (down)
      (south)

DIR_NORTH                     0
DIR_EAST                      1
DIR_SOUTH                     2
DIR_WEST                      3
DIR_UP                        4
DIR_DOWN                      5

Most muds use: D4 but DDIR_UP to make an upward direction works too for
emud.  Each exit starts with its own direction field, and contains an
exit description and door keyword list, (both of which can be left blank
with a tilde), and a fourth line containing a door type, key number,
and exit-to-room number.  Rooms without exits need no direction fields
and the etc...this section may be safely ignored.

The exit description is used for when a player types look <direction>.
This should in most cases be a vague description of what the next room
might be, and is followed by a tilde on a line by itself.  Each exit
starts with its own direction field, and contains a door keyword list
and The next field is the door keyword list, used for manipulative
door actions, such as open, close, pick, etc.  These words are
separated by a space, and are followed by a tilde on the same line.

The door type can be the following values:

                 0   Standard hallway without door
EX_ISDOOR        1
EX_CLOSED        2
EX_LOCKED        4   Does not necessarily require a key */
EX_HIDDEN        8   cannot be seen without detect hidden
EX_PICKPROOF    32   only greater pick will open door
EX_BASHPROOF    64   cannot be bashed open
EX_MAGIC_PROOF 128   cannot be dissolved with unbarring ways

The key number is simply the vnum of the key that can open the door.
A door without a keyhole is represented by a -1 in this spot.

The exit-to-room number is the vnum of the room where the exit leads to.
Use the QQ system here.  If the room connects to an outside room leave a
ZZZZ here, with an extra description of where the room should connect.
Try to make geographical correct outside connections.

Please note that adding a description for the door itself is usually done
under the 'extra descriptions' part of the room db.


*** Falls  -  For Air and Cliffs

    Rooms that characters may fall from have a section designated with the
    letter 'F'.  This is followed by the room that they fall into, and the
    distance of the fall.

F <room to fall into> <slope of cliff> <distance of fall in feet>

    This modifier for a room takes into play the skill of CLIMB and flying.
    The only special case is where the sector type is SECT_AIR.  This special
    case will check to see if the character is flying, or immediately damage
    them.  All other sector types are considered cliffs, and will check both
    dexterity and the climb skill.  Flying does not affect any aspect of the
    non-air types of sectors, with the assumption that.. dunno..

    it's a weird world we mud in :)


    The Marauder class has the climb ability that greatly increases the chance
    of safety for players in a cliff modified room.  The only other modifier is
    dexterity.  The longer a player stays on a cliff, the higher the likelyhood
    that they will fall.  The slope of a cliff is defined as 0 for a slight
    incline, to 10 for a vertical cliff face.  This number is ignored for
    SECT_AIR.  When a player falls, two things happen.  They are damaged by the
    amount defined by an equation based on how many feet the fall was.  And
    they are transfered to the room pointed to by the "room to fall into"
    field.

    An area creator can use this to make a dangerous section for players to
    cross, such as a path up a mountain.  This gives them a chance to fall back
    down the path.  The SECT_AIR is quite dangerous, in that losing fly causes
    an instant fall.  A trick that can be used to simulate a rocky terrain is
    to have a fall of a few feet, and make the fall room point to itself.

    Be aware that more creative tumbles can be created with a mobile program.


*** TIPS and OBSERVATIONS

    Make a master plan before you start building, that might prevent having to
    delete or rewrite several parts of your area.

    For a working door, the rooms on each side must have matching doors
    and doorflags.  Also the #RESETS section must have the associated close
    door command to close, lock, or reopen the door every repop.



5. The #MOBILES section

The #MOBILES section contains everything the mud needs to know about the mobs,
except for where they are and what they're holding.  Each mob in the file is
in sequential vnum order.

Mobiles may also contain some form of mob_prog.  These programs make the
mobile appear more life-like, and can be used to set up puzzles or quests.
Mob_progs allowing a quest are a "must" for every emud area. Mob_progs are
described later in this text.

This section in the .are file will always start first with this line:
#MOBILES

This section in the .are file will always end with with this line:
#0

  Now, to explain, line-by-line:

#QQ00

  The vnum of the mob.  Read the section on Virtual Numbers in part 3 of
  this document for more information.

mob example~

  The namelist of this mob: what words can be used to interact with this mob.
  For instance, 'kill mob' or 'kill example' would both be valid for this mob.
  Note the tilde following the field.

the Example Mob~

  The short desc of the mob.  Used in messages such as:
  "You poke the Example Mob."
  "the Example Mob pounds you!"

  This is the last time we'll note the tilde following the description.

An example mob stands...
~

  The long desc of the mob.  Used as part of a room description when a player
  enters or looks in a room.

The example mobs looks...
~

  This is the description of the mob; what a player sees when typing:
  'look' at the mob.

194 8 100 S

  The first number is the ACTION flag of the mob, which tell the mud how the
  mob should act.

  The second number is the AFFECTION flag, which tells the mud about any
  special abilities the mob might have.  Both these flag values work as per
  the section 'FLAGS' in part 3 of this handbook.
  See 'ACTION & AFFECTION FLAGS' below for more on both of these.

  The third number is the alignment of the mob, ranging from 1000 (good) to
  -1000 (evil).

  The 'S' stands for simple mob.  This feature is not used in Emud,
  and is left there as a placeholder.  Always use an 'S' here.
  This feature is used for backward compatibility.

1 20 10 1d6+2 1d4+0

  Field one is the mob's level.

  The second field is the body parts that can fall off when the mob dies.

  The third field is the body parts that attack.

  Field four is the mobs hit points.  There is more on Hitpoints and damage
  below in the aptly named 'HITPOINTS and DAMAGE'.

  The fifth field is how much damage a mob does with its bare hands.

10 2

  The first number is how much gold pieces this mob is carrying.

  The second field was used for exp on DIKU and Merc games, we ignore
  exp in files, and allow this field to define the race of the mobile
  if the action flags include ACT_RACE.

7 7 0

  The first and second number are the mob's loading and default position,
  respectively.  There is a section below: 'POSITIONS' that will explain
  more.

  The final number is the mob's gender; 0 is neuter, 1 is male, 2 is female.



*** DESCRIPTIONS

    Descriptions are done much the same way as those in the section in 'Rooms',
    earlier in this handbook.  The reader is encouraged to go back and reread
    that section if necessary.  However, the placement of tilde's is still very
    important.

- Name list~          name of the mobile

- Short description~  shown when interacting with the mobile

- Long description~   shown when typing 'look' in the room the mob stands.

- Description~        shown when you look at the mobile.



*** ACTION & AFFECTION FLAGS

    Action flags tell the mud how a mob behaves, and affection flags control
    the special qualities of a mob.  These flags are added together as
    described in 'FLAGS', in part 3 of this handbook.

    Remeber that the flags can be referenced as the flag name itself.  Below
    is a listing of flags for each type, with descriptions of what each does:

ACT_SCAVENGER        4   Picks up objects
ACT_DRUNK            8   Talks drunk
ACT_AGGRESSIVE      32   Attacks PC's
ACT_WIMPY          128   Flees when hurt
ACT_TRAIN          512   Can train PC's
ACT_PRACTICE      1024   Can practice PC's

AFF_SANCTUARY          128  The mobile is affected by the spell sanctuary.
AFF_FAERIE_FIRE        256  The mobile is affected by the spell faeire fire.
AFF_UNDERSTAND        2048  The mobile can understand anyone.
AFF_SNEAK            32768  The mobile is sneaking, players to not see it move.

AFF_TONGUES       16777216  Allows the mobiles to speak all languages.
AFF_ETHEREAL      33554432  Makes the mobile absolutely invisible to system


*** Note:
    Please remember not to use any combination of values that will
    select a bit outside of those shown.  Although combining valid
    bits are allowed.


*** Simple/Complex

    The 'S' at the end of the affects field is a placeholder that is
    ignored by Emud.  It should always be an 'S'.  Originally it was to
    select Simple or Complex mobiles in Diku muds.  It is here to support
    backward compatibility.


*** BODY PARTS

    This field was used by Thac0 on Merc and Diku muds, but is ignored
    on Emud.  Therefore it can be used by a different value.  But you must
    give a flag to tell Emud that this is a valid field.  This flag is
    ACT_BODY, and should obviously go in the Action Flags field.  If the
    ACT_BODY flag is not set, then body parts will be ignored.

    We advise selecting one or two body parts on all mobiles.

    Body parts are the parts that can be chopped off when the mobile dies.
    They will not show up elsewhere except in attack parts.  Body parts
    might give a slightly different version than attack parts, as in
    BODY_MOUTH, which is a jaw bone in body parts, and a bite in attack
    parts.  Any combination of body parts may be used, and it does not
    necessarily have to match the attack parts.  Only one is selected when
    the body part is chopped off with a 25% chance that the body part will
    even fall off.  It is not suggested to select two arms, as this will
    cause an error, only one is required.

    Below are the flags and spams for body parts listed.

BODY_HEAD       $n's head slowly falls off.
BODY_MOUTH      $n's jaw drops to the floor.
BODY_EYE        $n's eyeball pops out.
BODY_TORSO      $n is broken into pieces.
BODY_HIP        $n falls to pieces.
BODY_LEG        $n kicks $s leg off.
BODY_ARM        $n's arm seems to have been unattached.
BODY_WING       $n is flying nowhere.
BODY_TAIL       $n can no longer wag $s tail.
BODY_TENTICLE   $n's tenticle gushes bloody.
BODY_HORN       $n's horn bumps you as it falls to the floor.
BODY_CLAW       The claw of $n gets clipped.
BODY_HAND       $n gives you the finger, right before losing $s hand.
BODY_FOOT       $n stumbles, as $s foot falls off.



***  ATTACK PARTS

    This field was originally AC on Diku and Merc muds.  This field is
    normally ignored on Emud, but with the ACT_BODY flag selected, the
    field becomes the attack parts of the mobile.  Attack parts is how
    the mobile attacks.  The different kinds of attacks from various body
    parts do not affect damage, as it only changes what is printed when the
    attack takes place.  This feature is required, but is there to give
    the mobiles the correct forms of bare-hand attacks.
    Attack parts use the same field values as that of the body parts.
    Mobiles with weapons will always override the different kinds of
    body attacks.

    Note:  AC, or Armor Class is computed by the game itself, and is
    dependant on the level of the mobile.  If the mobile is should
    normally be wearing armor, the armor will add 2/3 of it's normal
    AC bonus.  If the mobile is not weaing armor, and is normally
    supposed to be wearing armor, then the AC of the mobile is
    1/3 of the value of the armor less than the normal AC for a
    mobile of the same level.

Below are the flags and spams for attack parts listed.

BODY_HEAD       head butt
BODY_MOUTH      bite
BODY_EYE        evil-eye
BODY_TORSO      shoulder slam
BODY_HIP        hip slam
BODY_LEG        knee
BODY_ARM        elbow slam
BODY_WING       flap
BODY_TAIL       tail slap
BODY_TENTICLE   tenticle whip
BODY_HORN       horn jab
BODY_CLAW       claw
BODY_HAND       punch
BODY_FOOT       kick



*** HITPOINTS and DAMAGE

    The functions of hitpoints and damage are arrayed randomly by the
    mud, as a function of imaginary dice and bonuses.  These always
    follow the form xdy+z, where x is the imaginary amount of dice, y is
    how many sides these dice have, and z is a constant being added to the
    final total.

    For example, our example mob had hitpoints of 1d6+2: a random
    number between 1 and 6, then add 2, for a range of 3-8.  Another mob
    might have 10d10+150 for a range of 160-250.  Damage is calculated the
    same way.

    These fields must follow the form xdy+z, even if z equals 0!
    For instance, our example mob does 1d4+0 damage with its bare hands...
    Leaving any of these fields blank will cause errors for the load
    procedure.

    One more important thing to know about damage: this is the
    mob's damage with its fists/claws/what-have-you.  If the mobile is
    wielding a weapon, the mobile will do it's basic damage plus one-half
    of the damage of the weapon wielded.

Standards and Measures

    These are the suggested strengths of mobs.


    level 60 mobs or lower :

    minimum hitpoints : 10 + level * level * 0.5
    maximum hitpoints : 20 + level * level * 1.5

    minimum damage    :  2 + level * 0.5
    maximum damage    :  5 + level * 3.0


    level 61 mobs and higher :

    minimum hitpoints : level * level * 0.7
    maximum hitpoints : level * level * 1.5

    minimum damage    : level * 0.7
    maximum damage    : level * 3.00

These values are checked with the areacheck tool by the emud admins.


*** GOLD

   This is simply the amount of gold that the mobile is carrying when it
   is loaded.  All mobiles can carry some amount of gold.

   maximum gold       : level*1500


*** RACE

    This field was previously used for exp for the mobile, but Emud calculates
    exp based on the level of the mobile.  This leaves the field open for more
    important things:  Race.  The creator must define the ACT_RACE bit in the
    action flags, and then use one of the RACE_ types in this field.  This will
    fix the mobile as to what language it speaks and understands.  It will also
    allow mobprogs to be used based on race.  You must pick a race which is one
    of the basic 29, even if the mobile should be something outside of those
    defined.  Just pick the closest one.


*** POSITION

    A mob always has two position numbers: its loading position,
    and its default position.  A mob will be loaded into its loading
    position initially, and after fighting, will return to its default
    position.  Note that these do not have to be the same, but usually
    are.

    The valid positions are:

POS_SLEEPING  4
POS_RESTING   5
POS_FIGHTING  6
POS_STANDING  7

    There are a few more positions than these, but are not used
    except during fighting, which the mud takes care of automatically.

*** GENDER

    This is the sex of the mobile, and has only three possible values:

SEX_NEUTRAL      0
SEX_MALE         1
SEX_FEMALE       2


*** TIPS and OBSERVATIONS

    Mobs wander around by default.  Remember to include the 'Sentinel'
    Action flag for stationary mobs!

    Freak mobs can be simulated by loading them sitting and agressive,
    with a default position of standing.  After being attacked, they will
    wander around instead of sitting back down!  Other interesting things
    can be done with the position values as well...

    Don't forget to add the 'smart' Action flag if you want your mob to
    talk. Neither add 'smart' to all mobs, unless you want a boar to
    shout for revenge when it tries to get back at an attacker.



6.  The #OBJECTS section

An object is any item in the game, be it unmovable rock, the fountain in
market square, or that nice sword Everyman the Barbarian has.  Everything
the mud needs to know about objects can be found in the #OBJECTS section,
except for where they actually are.

This section in the .are file will always start first with this line:
#OBJECTS

This section in the .are file will always end with with this line:

*** Field by Field Breakdown

    The following is a list of each of the fields of the Object format.


*** Vnum

#QQ00

    This is identical to the method of the mobile vnum.
    This number may be the same as a room or mobile, but no other
    object may have this number.
    See the section on virtual numbers in Part 3 of this Handbook.


*** Name list

sword example~

    The words can be used to manipulate the object.
    In this case, either of the words 'sword' or 'example'
    can be used in conjunction with a wield, drop, take, etc.
    This field requires a '~' or tilde at the end of the line.

    For use with mob_progs and obj_progs all names are appended
    with a special name starting with 'I' and followed by the
    vnum of the object.  This is used to specifically point to
    a particular key, if the player has several keys.
    ex:   item vnum is 9775,   added keyword is 'I9775'


*** Short description

an example sword~

    This is seen when the object is the target of a command:
    'You wield an example sword.'  'You give an example sword to...'.


*** Long description

An example sword lies on the ground, examping.
~

    This is what a player sees if the object is lying in a room by itself.


*** Description

It looks very shiny and polished, as if someone
is taking care to try to make a good example.
~

    In Emud, this field is used as the default "look" at the item,
    for example, if you did "look sword" while holding this item.
    Diku used this field for an action, and Merc ignored it.


*** Object Type

    This determines what is affecting the object.  Also note the
    ITEM_FLAG_LEVEL is required on Emud.  This is a flag that lets
    the field of the level work.  If this flag is not set, the level
    field is ignored, and item level might be calculated incorrect.

*** Object Values

0 3 1 10

    These are the object's values.  What each number means is completely
    dependant on what Type of object it is.

*** OBJECT VALUES

    The four numbers consisting of the 'item values' are different
    for each type of item.  Below the meanings of these numbers are broken
    down by each type.  Zeroes refer to fields not used, while letters are
    explained for each section...

    please note this is basically lifted verbatim from the dikudocs.

          The above values for drunkness/fullness/thirst are used per
          four "units" drunk. The values are expressed in HOURS!

          Example:
          Dragon drinks 7 times milk
          His Drunkness is not changed: (7*0) hours
          His Fullness increases by:    (7*2) hours
          His Thirst increases by:      (7*6) hours

          The hours above are numbers between 0 and 24. 24 hours is
          maximum for drunkness/fullness/thirst. When hours are zero
          for any drunkness/fullness/thirst the person will be
          sober, hungry, or thirsty respectively.

Value[3]: if this value is non-zero, then the drink is poisoned.
          NOT_POISONED  0
          POISONED      1

ITEM_KEY (18)
Value[0]: The key-type. This value must match the lock-type the door
          that the key can open (if the vnum of the key doesn't match
          the lock-type that is).
Value[1]: -
Value[2]: -
Value[3]: -

ITEM_FOOD (19)
Value[0]: The number of hours, that this food will fill the stomach
Value[1]: -
Value[2]: -
Value[3]: If this value is non-zero, the food is poisoned.
          NOT_POISONED  0
          POISONED      1

ITEM_MONEY (20)
Value[0]: The number of gold coins "in the pile of coins".
Value[1]: -
Value[2]: -
Value[3]: -

ITEM_BOAT (22)
Value[0]: -
Value[1]: -
Value[2]: -
Value[3]: -

ITEM_FOUNTAIN (22)
Value[0]: -
Value[1]: -
Value[2]: -
Value[3]: -

ITEM_PILL (22)
Value[0]: Level of the spell in the potion.
Value[1]: Which spell (Listed in spells.txt)
Value[2]: Which spell
Value[3]: Which spell

ITEM_AMMO (22)
Value[0]: Ammunition type (matches Value[0] of weapon that will shoot it)
Value[1]: Damage          (amount of damage caused by the ammo when it hits)
Value[2]: Speed           (4/second, keep numbers high (20 for fast arrows))
Value[3]: Effective range (number between 1 and 5)

          To create a ranged weapon with ammo, the weapon must also be
          created.  This is done by adding the vnum of the ammo to Value[0]
          of the weapon.


*** Object Weight

5

    The weight of the object.


*** Value

1000

    The value of the object, in gold coins.


*** Level

10

    This is the level of the object.  It is only valid if the
    ITEM_FLAG_LEVEL flag is valid.  Emud requires this field to be
    used.  Level is calculated by the game otherwise, to support
    backward compatibily.

*** Extra Descriptions

E
sword example~
This is a rather boring example.
~

    This is an extra description, and behaves EXACTLY like the extra
    descriptions of rooms.  The reader is referred to Part 4 of this
    Handbook for more information.

*** APPLIES

A 1 1

    These are 'applies' of the weapon...the 'A' signifying that
    an apply is forthcoming.  The second digit is the type of
    apply, and the third how much the apply is worth.

    An item apply is a particular effect the item has upon the
    holder/wielder/wearer's statistics.  There can be a maximum of three
    applies on an item, each requiring their own 'A' flag to let the mud
    know that there is more than one apply.  Thus, a sword that added one
    to a character's strength, and -10 to his hitpoints would be:

    A APPLY_STR   1
    A APPLY_HIT -10

    Below is a list of the different types of applies, and their values.

APPLY_NONE                    0
APPLY_STR                     1
APPLY_DEX                     2
APPLY_INT                     3
APPLY_WIS                     4
APPLY_CON                     5
APPLY_SEX                     6
APPLY_MANA                   12
APPLY_HIT                    13
APPLY_MOVE                   14
APPLY_AC                     17
APPLY_HITROLL                18

APPLY_SAVING_SPELL           24


*** Combat Usages

C
whack~
FLAG_CLASS_WARRIOR

    This is a system to change the default statement made when a weapon hits
    an opponent.  It also allows you to specifically define which classes can
    use the weapon, even if that class cannot normally wield the type of
    weapon defined by weapon type.  The creator should use the weapon type
    field (value 3) to set up weapons for backstabbing, shooting, throwing,
    etc.  All npc's can wield the item if any class is defined.
    Class selection method will default to the normal method if no classes
    are selected (Put a '0' in the field).

    The weapon defined in the example will 'whack' the opponent, and can be
    wielded by warriors.

    List of flags of classes

FLAG_CLASS_WARRIOR           1
FLAG_CLASS_GLADIATOR         2
FLAG_CLASS_MARAUDER          4
FLAG_CLASS_NINJA             8
FLAG_CLASS_DRUID            16
FLAG_CLASS_SORCERER         32
FLAG_CLASS_SHAMAN           64
FLAG_CLASS_WARLOCK         128

    Please note that FLAG_CLASS_ values are not the same as CLASS_ values



*** Object Programs

    Object programs are based on intercepting user commands, and substituting
    new ones with actions outside of normal game operation.  Several programs
    may be included on each object.  These programs, used in combination with
    mob_progs can lead to very complex systems of commands.  Object programs
    can also trigger off of basic time increments, damaging others, getting
    damaged, wearing or removing the object with the program.  They cannot
    trigger off of things that the player sees, or text on the screen.

    Trigger off things seen on the screen is limited to mob_progs, and will
    not be included in object programs, due to operational speed problems.

    Object programs start with a 'P' similar to object extra descriptions.
    Following the 'P' is a number describing the index value of the program,
    for branching operations to reference.

    An object will usually have a group of small 'programs' or execution units
    that do individual commands.  There is always a 'Trigger' that will start
    the program, and a 'response' that does some form of action.  The trigger
    need not be related to the response.  This also means that the response
    does not know why it was triggered, and responses cannot be based on them.
    Ex: An object may not give back the same amount of hit points to the player
    if a damaged trigger was used, but it may give back some fixed amount,
    because it knows that the player was hit.

    In programs with the same index, execution of a command will start with
    the first one that gets triggered regardless of the index number.  But
    the system will then flow through to any subsequent program with the same
    index number.  This will allow the programs to do several routines on one
    trigger.

*** IMPORTANT:  Each program set must have a unique index number.

    Object programs basically follow the format of trigger followed by
    response.  Each type of obj_prog trigger has a special format:

    Normal command intercept:

P <reference number>
TRIGGER <percentage> <game command>
{responses}

    Percentage is the chance that the command will be intercepted.
    Game command is the command you wish to intercept.


    TRIG_UNKNOWN

P <reference number>
TRIG_UNKNOWN <percentage> <unknown command>
{responses}

    Unknown command is either a social command, or something new that would
    not be a normal command, such as "polish" or "brush".


    TRIG_VOID

P <reference number>
TRIG_VOID
{responses}

    This is generally used as the end effect of a branching response.


    TRIG_TICK

P <reference number>
TRIG_TICK <percentage>
{responses}

    This is triggered once every 4 seconds of real time.  It can be used to make
    the player do things they did not intend to do.  Or occasionally modify
    stats, or any other time based reaction.


    TRIG_HIT

P <reference number>
TRIG_HIT <percentage>
{responses}

    This trigger is called every time the player with the object is hit in a
    non magical way.  This can be used to make objects that heal the player
    every time they are hit, or objects that scream whenever they are damaged.



    TRIG_DAMAGE

P <reference number>
TRIG_DAMAGE <percentage>
{responses}

    This is called every time a player damages another character, either a
    mobile, or player in a non magical way.  It can be used to create objects
    that say something or any other response to the damage given.


    TRIG_WEAR

    This is called everytime the object with the program is worn. It can be
    used to make a magical weapon greet its new owner.


    TRIG_REMOVE

    This is called everytime the object with the program is removed. It can
    be used to remove a disguise that was set upon wearing.


    TRIG_ROOM_COMMAND

    This is called everytime a player uses defined command in the room in
    which the object lies. You can use ethereal objects if needed, it's
    the result that counts.


    TRIG_ROOM_UNKNOWN

    This is called everytime a player uses defined keyword in the room in
    which the object lies.


    TRIG_SACRIFICE

    This is called when a player sacrifises the object with the program.


*** RESPONSES

    Each type of obj_prog response has a special format.  The only time a
    tilde is required is after a string is used.  Commands such as OPROG_APPLY
    should not have a tilde after them.


    OPROG_ECHO

P 1
TRIG_UNKNOWN 100 EXAMPLE
OPROG_ECHO
bla bla bla bla~

    These lines are given to the user only.  Be sure to include the tilde.


    OPROG_GOD_COMMAND

P 1
TRIG_UNKNOWN 100 EXAMPLE
OPROG_GOD_COMMAND
say Greetings&
smile self&
say the name is $I, Sir $I~

    These commands are given at the trust level of 98.  This means that the
    user is able to perform god commands for the duration of the object
    program.  Several commands may be used, and separated by the '&' symbol.

    The '$' allows you to print player related information:
    $i name of the player
    $I name and title of the player
    $m him her it  (based on player sex)
    $s his her its
    $e he  she it
    $o short description of the object

    Always use 'self' to refer to the player when the name doesn't need to
    be printed.

    All mobile program commands can be used.

    It should be noticed that objects can use quest bits to their fullest by
    allowing objects to read and write both the object's and the player's
    quest bits.

    Example:

OPROG_GOD_COMMAND
mpmset self long A small turtle named $ stands here.~

    This would set the description that others see when entering the
    room the player is in, very similar to the skill disguise.  To
    reset the string to normal game operation, use:

OPROG_GOD_COMMAND
mpmset self long null

say beam me up scotty!&
mpecho {170}$I starts to fade and waves goodbye at $s friends.&
mpgoto ~

    This command allows the use of one command, but the inclusion of an
    argument.  This allows special commands like GOTO to let the user pick
    a destination.  It makes sure that the user cannot put any multi-line
    commands so they will be limited to the one command given.  This is used
    to give the player the full advantage of the god command.  Use this
    only under permission of the game administrators. $I will print the
    player's name and honorific, the $s prints his/her/its based on gender.
    Example of the above program executed by a player named Neophyte.

    Sword Master Neophyte says 'beam me up scotty!'
    Sword Master Neophyte starts to fade and waves goodbye at his friends.



    OPROG_APPLY <APPLY_TYPE> <AMOUNT>

P 1
TRIG_TICK 100
OPROG_APPLY OAPPLY_HIT 25

    This command is executed to change one of several stats of the player that
    has the current object.  These will only affect the current stats, and
    never the maximum, as most other object affects to.  It is allowed to
    make the amount either positive or negative.

    Apply types:

    OAPPLY_HIT       - Applies to current hit points.
    OAPPLY_MOVE      - Applies to current movement points.
    OAPPLY_MANA      - Applies to current mana points.
    OAPPLY_ALIGNMENT - Applies to current alignment.


    OPROG_JUNK

P 1
TRIG_HIT 100
OPROG_ECHO
Your shield shatters into a million pieces!~
P 1
TRIG_VOID
OPROG_JUNK

    This command will destoy the item that is executing the program.  This is
    the only bug free method unlike sacrifice, eat, or mpjunk


    OPROG_IF_HAS_OBJECT <VNUM> <TRUE DESTINATION> <FALSE DESTINATION>

P 1
TRIG_UNKNOWN 100 EXAMPLE
OPROG_IF_HAS_OBJECT 21 2 3
P 2
TRIG_VOID
OPROG_ECHO
I have the object with vnum: 21~
P 3
TRIG_VOID
OPROG_ECHO
I do not have the object with vnum: 21~

    This command will branch successfully if the player has the object in
    either inventory or equipment, but not in a container.
    In this case the P 2 will be jumped to if the if check is true.
    If the if check is false P 3 will be called.

    Do aknowledge you can only jump to a higher reference number.
    if a lower number is given than the if check itself the program will
    be aborted.

    OPERATOR

    <   - Less than

    =   - Equal to
    !   - Not equal to

    VALUE

    The value is a number that the check variable is compared against.

    True destination is the obj_prog index (the one listed after the 'P')
    that the branch will continue when the if check is true.

    False destination is the obj_prog index that is executed when the if
    check is false.

    If the destination number is not found, then the branch will not be
    successful, and the program will stop.  This can be used for branches
    that are not necessary to the operation of the program.

    When using 0 as the destination number the program will always abord.
    It's suggested to use 0 so an area admin won't waste time looking for
    a non existant destination number.


    OPROG_QUEST_SET <OFFSET> <NUMBITS> <VALUE>

P 1
TRIG_UNKNOWN 100 EXAMPLE
OPROG_QUEST_SET 0 4 15

    This is a method of setting the value of the quest bits on an object.
    The offset is the starting bit number of the grouped quest numbers.
    The numbits are the amount of bits involved with the defined value.
    The value is the desired value of the set.

    OPROG_QUEST_ADD <OFFSET> <NUMBITS> <VALUE>

P 1
TRIG_WEAR 100
OPROG_QUEST_ADD 4 4 1

    This is a method of adding a value to the quest bits of an object.
    The offset is the starting bit number of the grouped quest numbers.
    The numbits are the amount of bits involved with the defined value.
    The value is the desired increment being added to the quest bits.

    The number inside the defined bit range will never overflow to higher
    bits, or go below zero.  The value may be negative to subtract.
    This can be used to make items that have limited lifespan.

    In this example the value will go when wearing several times to :

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on.

P 1
TRIG_UNKNOWN 100 TEST
OPROG_PLAYER_QUEST_IF 0 1 = 1
OPROG_ECHO
Your first bit has value 1~

    The quest if check allows branching to other obj_progs.
    The offset is the starting bit number of the grouped quest numbers.
    The numbits are the amount of bits involved with the defined value.
    The quest bits checked will be those of the area the object belongs to.

    Operator:

        <   - Less than
        >   - Greater than
        =   - Equal to
        !   - Not equal to

     The value is a number that the check variable is compared against.
     True destination is the program index (the one listed after the 'P') that
     the branch will continue when the if check is true.
     False destination is the obj_prog index that is executed when the if
     check is false.
     If the destination number is not found or goes backwards, then the branch
     will not be successful, and the program will stop.  This can be used for
     branches that are not necessary to the operation of the program. It's
     good practise to branch to 0 in this case, which will always abord the
     program.


**  Example Programs:

P 1
TRIG_COMMAND 45 say
OPROG_GOD_COMMAND
mpechoat self {160}You are occasionally tongue tied.&
mpechoaround self $n tries to speak but $e seems tongue tied.~
P 2
TRIG_UNKNOWN 100 HOME
OPROG_IF OIF_WEAR_LOC = WEAR_NONE 3 4
P 3
TRIG_VOID
OPROG_ECHO
You must wear the example object (with program) to go home.~
P 4
TRIG_VOID
OPROG_GOD_COMMAND
mpechoaround self {030}$I says 'I'm going home!'&
mpgoto 9755&
say I'm home!~


Explanation:

The first section of the program is a simple command trigger.  45% of the time
that the user tries to use the 'say' command, it will not be functional, and
the user will see the response that he is tongue tied. The mpechoaround will
send the same message to everyone but the user standing in the same room.

The rest of the program checks when the user types the unknown command
'HOME'.  If that is typed, then the If Check checks for the wear location of
the object.  If the wear location equals WEAR_NONE (item is not worn),
then the command continues with program 3.  If the item is worn, then the
program will continue with program 4.

The next program has a void trigger, and can only be reached by the previous
branch statement.  The user is messaged to wear the object.

The final program has a void trigger too.
Faking that the player says he is going home,
then to 'mpgoto', a mob command, the location of 9755, which is the square
in the city of Roterodamum.
Then the user is forced to say: I'm home!


Notes on obj_progs:

It can easily be seen that there is a very large amount of room for
improvement on object_programs of this type.  This system has been set
up because obj_programs are searched MANY more times than mob_progs,
and require a significantly longer amount of CPU time to process than
mob_progs.  Therefore a tokenized method was developed instead of the
interpreted system of the mob_progs.  Essentially the format in the .are
file is the same that the database system saves all the information.
Using this tokenized system is at least 4 times faster for the CPU than
an interpreted based system.

More complex object programs can be realized by asking the Emud implementors
to add new types of triggers and responses.  This system is relatively new,
and has not been fully tested for CPU usage, but early tests show that the
response time is such that 50 people having 20 items with complex programs
each, should not noticeably degrade system performance.  For the sake of
safety, both the commands of 'save' and 'quit' are removed from those allowed
in obj_prog responses.  Be very careful with using the god commands, as they
can permanently change the statistics of players, rooms, and just about
anything in the game.

*** Important:

    It is allowable to delete the item as a final command.

    The JUNK command will always automatically terminate object programs,
    regardless if the object program continues.


QUEST BITS:

    This is generally a very complex system to initially understand, therefore
    The following is a detailed description of how quest bits work.

    Quest bits are used in 3 places.

    -Each player has a set of quest bits for each area, so that a player may
     be on several quests, and each area has it's own set, without worrying
     about other areas.
    -Each mobile has one set of quest bits. (not saved during crashes)
    -Each item has one set of quest bits.

    It should generally be considered that you should not allow modifications
    of quest bits by an something from one area to another.  As each set of
    quest bits are defined completely by the area creator.

    Quest bits are used to allow the area creator the ability to define their
    own set of variables that are constant for that individual, object, or
    mobile.

    This means that once the value is set, it is saved throughout the game,
    and allows various states, or steps in a quest to be marked.  The
    definition of a quest is the ability of the game to know how far a player
    has gotten in an area regardless if they come back to the game several
    days later.

    Each set of quest bits is really a set of user definable 128 bits.
    Some knowledge of binary numbers helps in decifering this system
    completely, but is not necessary.

    The offset is always the starting point of where the defined value is.
    The amount of bits defines the totaly range of the values used.

    With basic binary system, the amount of bits define an exponential range:

    1 bit - 2 values
    2     - 4
    3     - 8
    4     - 16
    5     - 32
    6     - 64
    7     - 128
    8     - 256

Ex. Say a creator wants to have 4 states on an object.  The first being the
    initial state, the second when a player hits a mobile, the third when
    the player goes to sleep, and the fourth when he wakes up.
    The area creator wants an object that poisons the player when he attacks
    a mobile, and damages them when the player wakes up.  The player is
    even informed that when he wakes up next, he will be hurting very bad.
    Since there are only 4 states, only 2 bits are required.

    Be aware that's only 2 out of 128 bits, this means you can pick the
    first available bits, but also the last available bits.

    Below we'll see some asci art showing the first 32 bits, be aware that
    the first bit has the location: 0, and bit 32 has location: 31

    In this example we'll only use the 5th and 6th bit, they're at
    locations: 4 and 5


       30  28  26  24  22  20  18  16  14  12  10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X| | |X|X|X|X|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ("X" indicates an unused bit)

    A bit has either value 0 or 1 which allows you to make 4 values:

    00  =  0  (initial state)
    01  =  1  (player has hit mobile)
    10  =  2  (players has gone to sleep)
    11  =  3  (player has woken up)

    If this is clear to you we'll once again concentrate on how to read
    and how to write these bits.

    Reading the bits:

    OPROG_OBJECT_QUEST_IF 4 2 = 3 6 8

    Freely translated:

    start reading at bit 4  +  read 2 bits
    if equals : 3 --> true:  branch to program 6
                      false: branch to program 8

    Writing goes almost the same way :

    To set the bits to have the value 2 -->

    OPROG_QUEST_SET 4 2 2


    Now what if you don't understand a single bit of the above? This is
    possible if you're not familiar with computer science. In that case
    you can use a set amount of values that always work. In that case we
    suggest you always use the format to remember 16 steps of a player's
    or object's quest bits:

    OPROG_QUEST_SET 0 4 <value ranging from 0 to 15)

    OPROG_OBJECT_QUEST_IF 0 4 = <value ranging from 0 to 15)

    The object starts with a value of 0

    use OPROG_QUEST_SET 0 4 2  to set quest to 2
    use OPROG_OBJECT_QUEST_IF 0 4 = 5  to see if the quest equals 5

    This will work for any value ranging from 0 to 15, thus there is
    no huge need to know how stuff exactly works, as long as you can
    use it.



*** TIPS and OBSERVATIONS

    Items with applies to stats over +3 should be very rare on most muds,
    and hard to get.

    A lot of small items make an area more interesting than a few incredibly
    powerful items, for the most part.  This is very subjective, however.
    Items that are too powerful may be changed by the game administrators,
    which usually annoys the administrator more. The better the area, and
    the quest you've written, the better the objects.

    Remember to put take wear-flags on almost everything.  It's easier to
    put a take wear-flag on everything, and take off the ones you don't
    need (like fountains and such).

    don't feel limited to items players consider 'useful', such as weapons
    and armor.  A giant (untakeable) monolith, and other strange and odd
    items can add a lot of atmosphere to an area.

    The ITEM_FLAG_INVENTORY has very special purposes and should not be used
    for normal items.  An object that is flagged as inventory will follow the
    player, even in  death.

    A mobile that is killed with an object that has an inventory type item will
    automatically delete the item.  This is useful for creating objects that
    the player desires, but cannot get.  An object with this flag can be given
    to the player by a mobile with mob_progs, or picked up off the ground.



7.  The #SHOPS section

    The #SHOPS section tells the mud each shop the kind of items it deals
    in.  It also tells the profit margins, and the hours open.  Usually all
    the numbers are on one line.

*** Shop Archetype

<Mob vnum> <type1> <type2> <type3> <type4> <type5> <%sell> <%buy> <open> <close>

*** Mob Vnum

    This is the mobile that works in the shop.

*** Type

    These five values are the ITEM_TYPE numbers that the shop deals in.
    The shop will only buy or sell these types of items.  Leaving a '0' in
    any of the slots will allow the shop to deal in less than five types of
    items, but a shop may never deal in more than five.

*** %Sell

    This is the percent of the normal value of an object when the shopkeeper
    sells it to a player.  Usually around 100.  This number is limited by
    the system and can only be 100 or higher.

*** %Buy

    This is the percent of the normal value of an object when the shopkeeper
    buys it from a player.  Usually around 50.  This number is also limited
    by the system and can only be 100 or less.

*** Hour Open

    This field is a number from 0 to 23 that is the hour that the shop opens.

*** Hour Close
    This field is a number from 0 to 23 that is the hour that the shop opens.

*** Note:
    Comments may be added after the Hour Closed following a ';'.
    The comments can only be as long as the screen length.

*** Note:
    Shops on Emud can be browsed through during off hours, but nothing
    can be bought there.  All shops are considered safe rooms at all
    times, even in off hours.


8.  The #RESETS section

    The #RESETS section tells the mud where everything goes, from the
    goblin in the pit to what the knight is wielding and putting the
    fountain in the square.  This section is simple a list of commands.

    The zone commands tell the mud exactly how to reset a zone,
    from mobs to objects, to closing doors.  Each command is given its own
    line, one after the other, until the end of the file.  Comments can be
    added for clarity's sake example:    ; big guy with sword

    Areas reset based on the average of all the levels of the mobiles in
    the area.  Low level areas take about 5 minutes to reset, and high
    level areas take about 15 minutes.  This number is fixed and continuous
    regardless of how many players are in the area.

*** Standard Fields

<if-flag>  An if flag tells the mud to look at the previous command.
           If the if-flag is 0, the mud will try to execute the command
           regardless of the previous command.  If the if-flag is any
           other than a zero (one is most commonly used), then that
           particular command will only execute if the command immediately
           preceding it did as well.

           This is useful for objects loaded onto mobs; you don't want
           to load a shield on a guard that didn't get loaded, for example.
           All in all it doesn't matter much.

<max #>    This is the maximum number of whatever this is can exist in the
           mud.  If on a mob command, this will do nothing.
           On an object command, this limits how many of this object are
           available in the game.  For items not limited, it is common to
           put a very high number in this slot, 100 should do in most cases.
           For something like recall scrolls you can settle for 999


*** List of all Commands

M <if-flag>  <mob vnum> <maximum> <room vnum>
G <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum>
E <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum> <wear location>

O <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum> <room vnum>
P <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum> <container vnum>

D <if-flag> <room vnum> <exit direction> <door flag>

R <if-flag> <room vnum> <last exit to randomize>


*** M <if-flag>  <mob vnum> <maximum> <room vnum>

    The M reset loads a mobiles to a certain place in the mud.


*** G <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum>

    The G reset loads an object and gives it to a mobile loaded in the
    reset immediately previous.  Note that this is different from
    the E reset below, in that the E reset loads an object and makes
    the mob equip it.  A G reset object stays in the mob's inventory.

    To make a unique item the <maximum> should be 1.  Generally this means
    that the object will not load if any others exist in the game.  There
    is a basic 20% chance that the object will load anyways when the mobile
    resets.  A mobile will reset after it is killed on the next area reset.

*** E <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum> <wear location>


    The E reset loads an object and makes the mob loaded in the reset
    immediately previous to this one equip it.

    Where equipment position is _one_ of the following:

    WEAR_LIGHT               0    WEAR_HANDS               9
    WEAR_FINGER_L            1    WEAR_ARMS               10
    WEAR_FINGER_R            2    WEAR_SHIELD             11
    WEAR_NECK_A              3    WEAR_ABOUT              12
    WEAR_NECK_B              4    WEAR_WAIST              13
    WEAR_BODY                5    WEAR_WRIST_L            14
    WEAR_HEAD                6    WEAR_WRIST_R            15
    WEAR_LEGS                7    WEAR_WIELD              16
    WEAR_FEET                8    WEAR_HOLD               17


*** O <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum> <room vnum>

    The O reset loads an object into a room.  This is mostly used for
    unowned or immovable objects.

    To make a unique item the <maximum> should be 1.  Generally this means
    that the object will not load if any others exist in the game.  There
    is a basic 20% chance that the object will load anyways when the area
    resets.

*** P <if-flag>  <obj vnum> <maximum> <container vnum>

    The P reset loads an object, and places it into another object
    (container-type) that was previously loaded.


*** D <if-flag> <room vnum> <exit direction> <door flag>

    The D reset can open, close, or close and lock a door every repop,

    Where door flag is _one_ of the following:

    DOOR_OPEN                0
    DOOR_CLOSED              1
    DOOR_CLOSED_LOCKED       2

    Where exit direction is one of the following:

    DIR_NORTH                0    DIR_WEST                 3
    DIR_EAST                 1    DIR_UP                   4
    DIR_SOUTH                2    DIR_DOWN                 5


*** R <if-flag> <room vnum> <last exit to randomize>

    The R reset randomizes the specified exits in a room.

    Where <last exit to randomize> is the number equivalent of the first
    exit in the room to not randomize.  For example:

R 0 6495 3

    would randomize the north(0), east(1), and south(2) doors of the room with
    the vnum 6495.  Swapping only those three exits.


*** TIPS and OBSERVATIONS

    Remember, a functioning door is a door from both sides, and needs to
    be closed from both sides.  Thus, 2 door resets for each door.

    The P reset gets confused if you try to load multiple objects
    into multiple containers IF the containers are all the same
    object.
    The solution is to copy the container over into the #OBJECTS section
    with a different vnum however many different containers you need.



9.  Putting it all together.

    This section is simply composed of building tips for novice
    builders.  This is very subjective, and based on the experiences of
    the builders at the Curious Area Workshop.  Not all these techniques
    may be of use to your average builder.


    Absolutely, positively use the AREACHECK utility.

    The areacheck utility comes with the utilites section of
    documents that goes along with this document.  The
    areacheck will normally allow the area to start right up
    unless you have doors specified wrong, or have problems
    with obj_progs or mob_progs.  Areacheck does a VERY good
    job of checking syntax, such as numbers that are off or
    spacing that is wrong.  It also checks the syntax or
    spelling of all the text versions of flags.


    Learn to build without an area editor first.

    Its a lot easier to troubleshoot when you understand what
    exactly goes on with all those numbers in those files...

    This is very important because most area editors are designed
    for Merc or Diku areas.  They are actually fine for making
    a framework for the area, but realize that MANY differences
    crop up in creating Emud areas.  And the creator must then
    use a text editor to finish out the area. Also the editors
    tend to make little errors, crashing the area editor and
    leaving one without advanced knowledge helpless.


    Do it on paper first.  Do it big.

    Having a map to work from helps a LOT when doing exits, and
    provides a visual impetus to getting all those tedious bits done.


    Do the #ROOMS section first.

    The #ROOMS section almost always takes the longest.  Once past that
    long fight, the #MOBILES and the rest will come easier.


    Save Mobile programs and Object programs till the very end.

    It is simpler to create obj_progs and mob_progs when all the
    mobiles and objects are in place, and the rooms are finished.

    BE aware that you might end up redoing alot of rooms, mobiles
    and objects because you want certain things in your quest which
    you make up while working on it. Therefor it is suggested to
    think very well about the quest you want to make. Write it down
    in steps. Then build your area such way that you can implement
    all the mobile and object programs without having to make heavy
    changes.

    Your #RESETS file will always be wrong on the first try.

    -Get used to it.

    Your mobile and object programs will suck and work badly on the
    first try.

    -Keep working on them till they work as you desire.


    For random mob distribution, use this method:

    (this was contributed by Locke of CthulhuMUD)

    Make a room, with exits to all the places that you would like mobs
    to come out of, in all 6 directions.  Load all mobs to be randomly
    distributed in this room, and they'll choose and walk out themselves!
    (if they're not sentinel).

    For a big area, several of these 'mob chutes' can be connected
    for a bubble-sort effect.


    An area will take twice as long as you think it will to build.

    a certain boredom sets in sometimes.  just set it aside for
    awhile if this happens; its better to build when you want to
    then turn out something uninspired.  If you plan on using
    obj_progs or mob_progs then the area will take four times
    as long as you expect.   If you plan on using quest bits, then
    count of it taking much longer than you expect, with several
    errors.

    Mobile and object programs are a MUST however, once you learn
    how to use them properly you'll be able to create an area
    unparalised by areas without progs.


    Be fair with the items:

    Good items should be hard to get.  Lousy items should require
    much less effort.  Give the ordinary stuff to the mobs to wear,
    and reserve the good stuff as a reward for the cool quest you'll
    hopefully write.

    Always remember that items and objects can easily get out of
    scale, and all areas can and probably will be modified by the
    implementors of a Emud system.  This is to be expected, so
    don't get too put out.

    Contributions to this section are welcome, and will be added with
    proper credits.

=== MOBprograms

    MOBprograms are a way to make your mobiles more interesting.  This
    basic version has enough to get things going, and should be quite
    readable and understandable and more to the point, extendable. The
    remainder of this document describes MOBprograms and gives a couple
    trivial examples.

-------------------------------The Basic Idea----------------------------------

    Ever wonder why most muds either seem dead or overcrowded? The answer
    is probably partially due to the fact that the mobiles never do anything
    but wait to be slaughtered.  Unless someone has gone to great lengths
    and added many special procedures, most mobiles have no idea you are in
    the room with them and rarely listen to what you say. The typical Midgaard
    mayor wanders happily along even when the populace pokes him, waves his
    City Key about, unlocks his gates, or frenchs his secretary, etc. So a way
    to give the mobiles a bit more spirit would be neat.

                              -Enter Mob Prog-

    The backbone of the MOBprograms shall be called triggers from this point
    on.  Essentially, they are procedure calls placed in sneaky places in
    the mud code which provide the context for what is going on around the
    mobile.  So, if something happens in the mobile's room and a trigger is
    activated, then a list of commands is sent to the interpreter in the
    mobile's name, thus making her/it/him do an appropriate something.

    Since knowing the appropriate response for every mobile to every
    possible trigger is not easy, this command list shouldnt be a rigid
    script, but needs to be somehow unique for the mobile and the situation.
    However, in order to know the situation, a mobile needs to know more
    about the trigger than that it just happened.  So, we have to include
    some sort of variables as well to set the context appropriately.

    As most implementors know, most area creators are not versed in coding,
    but usually have great ideas. Therefore, whatever system is used needs
    to be quite simple.  This is not to demean creators in anyway.  Simply,
    it is useless to have a powerful system, if the only person able to write
    anything is someone who finds C coding in general to be exciting and non
    frustrating.

    If that is going to be the case, then stick to the special procedures,
    since there is no bound to what a complex special procedure can accomplish.
    Yet, from experience working on several muds, most admins and implementors
    prefer not to be writing one shot spec_procs to satisfy the needs of their
    creators.  And not to be demeaning toward implementors, area creators who
    never wrote a c program have constructed mobile programs being far more
    complex and entertaining than 99% of the spec_procs.

    Thus, the basic idea:  let mobiles react to a myriad of mud
    events/situations by having them perform a list of commands which can be
    tailored to the moment through a simple and unintimidating scheme usable
    by any creator.


------------------------------MOBprogram Syntax--------------------------------

    The simplest way to describe any syntax is by example, so here goes.
    First, define the notation: anything contained in braces {} is required,
    anything in brackets [] is optional, anything in quotes "" is a case
    insensitive literal, NL refers to a required new-line. The meanings of
    the labels used will be described following the syntax diagram.

">" {trigger_type} " " {argument_list} "~" NL
{program_command_1} NL
{program_command_2} NL
{program_command_3} NL
     .   .   .
{program_command_N} NL
"~" NL

=== Explainations

    A TRIGGER_TYPE is one of the available triggers.
    A PROGRAM_COMMAND can be any legal mud command, or a control flow command.
    The ARGUMENT_LIST depends upon the trigger, but it is always parsed into
    the system as a character string.

    This is an example of ONE MOBProgram block for a mob.

--------------------Associating MOBprograms With A Mobile----------------------

    There is only one way for the mud to associate the program with the
    mobile.  The result is a link list of mob_programs which are
    attached to the mobile_prototype.  This is done at boot time, and so only
    one copy is kept, regardless of how many instances of the mobile are
    running about.

    In the #MOBILES section of your area files, at the end of the
    mobile's block (i.e. on the line following the typical position/default
    position/sex line), append any number of MOBprograms blocks
    (using the syntax above) followed by a line starting with one '|' (pipe).
    Example provided:  holygrove.are


-----------------------------Trigger Types----------------------------------

    Triggers are fairly easy to add, but this basic list should hold for
    most needs. Their names, argument list syntaxes, and translation into
    more articulate english are given below:


*** act_prog [p] <ARGUMENT>

    The argument is a list of keywords separated by spaces. If the first
    word is the character 'p' by itself then the rest of the word list is
    considered to be a phrase.  The trigger is activated whenver a keyword
    (or the phrase) is contained in the act() message. Both the phrase and
    keywords are case insensitive.

    This is the most general trigger.  It applies to almost every event
    which happens in the mud.  Anytime the function act() is called with
    a message to be delivered TO_CHAR,TO_VICT,TO_ROOM, etc. the act can be
    triggered.  Basically this will trigger on almost everything you'll
    ever want (and some things you wont as well). Do aknowledge only players
    can trigger an act_prog, mobs will be ignored.

    Example

    >act_prog p pokes you in the ribs.~
    This trigger will only be activated if a mobile receives a message
    in which the above five words are found in the exact order and
    spacing given. Note that the period is needed because the words
    must be found on their own. This eliminates confusion when the
    keyword is 'hi' and a message with the word 'this' is being checked.


*** speech_prog <ARGUMENT>

    The argument is the same as for an act_prog.  This works best when only
    one word is used as the argument, as several can cause the mob_prog to
    trigger several times in a row.

    Example

    >speech_prog the dog~
    The previous example is faulty, because it would trigger twice if the
    player said the words 'the' and 'dog' in the same sentence.

    Correct Example: >speech_prog dog~

    This is only triggered when the keyword is contained in a message which
    has been said by a PC in the same room as the mob.

    The PC restriction is not necessary, but makes infinite loops between
    two talking mobiles impossible. It also makes it impossible for two
    NPC's to stand and discuss the weather however.


*** rand_prog <NUMBER>

    The argument is a number betweeen 1 and 100 inclusive.

    This trigger is checked at each PULSE_MOBILE and if the argument is
    greater than a percentage roll the trigger is activated. This
    will happen even if there is no PC in the room with the mob.

    It is useful to give mobiles a bit of a personality. For instance
    a janitor who stops to spit tobacco, or complain about the hours,
    or wonder why there are no woman janitors on muds, or a fido which
    barks or growls or pees on the curb is much more alive than one
    which just sits there scavenging.

    If the $r Variable is used in the body of the trigger the trigger
    will only execute if there is a player in the room.
    To allow a mobile to work with both $r and without players in the
    room use 1 rand_prog having the $r part, and one rand_prog or a
    time_prog taking care of other stuff.  Only 1 rand_prog can trigger
    at each time.


*** fight_prog <NUMBER>

    The argument is a percentage like in rand_prog.

    Useful for giving mobiles combat attitude.  It is checked every
    PULSE_VIOLENCE when the mobile is fighting.  Can be used to cast
    spells, curse at the opponent, or whatever. Only the first successful
    one will be processed to save time.  Also, this means that the
    mobile wont get lucky and 1. curse, cast a fireball and 2. spit on the
    player, cast another fireball in the same pulse.


*** hitprcnt_prog <NUMBER>

    The argument is a percentage.

    Is activated at each PULSE_VIOLENCE when the mobile is fighting. It
    checks to see if the hitpoints of the mobile are below the given
    percentage.  Multiple hitprcnt_progs should be listed in increasing
    order of percent since a 40% will always be activated before a 20%
    and, only the first successful hitprcnt trigger is performed.

*** greet_prog <NUMBER>

    Again a percentage argument.

    Whenever someone enters the room with the mobile, and the mobile saw
    the person enter, this is checked. Good for shopkeepers who want
    to welcome customers, or for pseudo-aggressive mobiles which need to
    discriminate on who they attack.


*** all_greet_prog <NUMBER>

    Again a percentage argument.

    Like greet_prog, but it can be triggered even if the mobile didnt
    see the arrival (stealth, invis). Most useful for faking teleport
    rooms (if your mobiles can transfer) or for impassable guardians.

    Neither greet_prog is activated if the mobile is fighting.

    Do aknowledge that a mobile with detect_invis and detect_hidden
    will always trigger with a normal greet_prog.  Unless it has been
    blinded.  It is advised to use greet_prog to simulate more natural
    behavior, and use the all_greet_prog for mobiles without detection
    who still need to trigger. Or for ethereal mobs who don't need
    detects for the kind of greet program you have in mind.


*** entry_prog <NUMBER>

    Again a percentage argument.

    The opposite of a greet_prog. Whenver the mobile itself enters a new
    room, this can be triggered.  Useful for looking around, or waving
    or other things that real PCs do when they arrive at a crowded room.
    Only the first successful one of these is done so the mobile doesnt
    look stupid by repeating commands resulting from multiple MOBprograms.


*** give_prog <ARGUMENT>

    This command should always be used with the 'I' format for item vnums.

    Example

    A scroll of recall is vnum 9720, so use 'I9720' for the argument.

    >give_prog I9720~

    This is triggered whenever something is given to the mobile.  Best used
    for quests.


*** bribe_prog <NUMBER>

    The argument is any positive integer number.

    This trigger is activated whenever money is given to the mobile. If the
    amount given exceeds the number, then process the commands. Note again,
    that an argument of '1' would act as a default response.

    If money is given to a mobile with this trigger type, instead of the
    cash being added to mob->gold, the mobile is instead given a pile of
    coins in the proper amount. In this way, the mobile can drop the coins
    or refer to the pile of gold by I3 (item vnum is 3). And use $O to print
    the short description: "%d gold coins".


*** death_prog <NUMBER>

    The argument is a percent once again.

    When the mobile dies, if the random percentage is less than the argument
    the mobile performs the MOBprogram commands rather than the usual
    death_cry sequence.  This is done before the corpse is made, so the
    commands can be considered the mobiles last gasp.  It could perhaps
    destroy the items it was holding, or create some, or cast a spell
    on the killer and the room, or even goto a new location and die
    there (with a text message, the corpse would seem to vanish)  The
    position of the mobile is set to STANDING, and so it can do all the
    normal commands, without worrying about being DEAD.  However, even
    if the mobile restores itself to full hitpoints, it will still die.
    This is not a way to immortal mobiles. However, the last thing this
    mobile does could be to load a fresh version of itself, give all
    items to the new mob and force it to wear them, then have the new
    mob attack and mppurge self to disappear without leaving a corpse.
    (Note that your kitten could turn into a dragon this way too).


*** range_prog <number>

    The argument is a number between 1 and 100, but does nothing atm,
    might be a percentage in the future.

    The range_prog is triggered if the mobile is shot by a range weapon.
    The program can then check the shotfrom ($i) ifcheck to see which
    direction the shot came from.

    Note that the first successful bribe_prog, give_prog, hitprcnt_prog,
    death_prog, fight_prog, rand_prog and entry_prog is the only one which
    is executed.  All the successful greet_progs, speech_progs, and act_progs
    will be done. This is the best arrangement we found for handling
    situations where you imported several MOBprogram files for a mobile.
    If you are going to write lots of little files and piece them together
    to create the effect you want, it is advisible to not mix things together
    all that much, otherwise you have to pay close attention to the order in
    which the programs are added to the link list.

    You should avoid using triggers of the same type at all times, except
    for the $r situation, and hitprcnt_prog. When using hitprcnt_prog do
    not use a fight_prog unless you want both the fight and hitprcnt_prog
    to trigger in the same combat round.

    Also, no MOBprograms will be successful when the mobile is charmed or
    possessed to protect mobiles which are given special powers from being
    pimped by players.


----------------------------------Variables------------------------------------

    To make things come alive, variables are needed.  These are represented
    in the MOBprograms by using a dollar sign convention as in the socials.
    When the mud command is processed, these variables are expanded into the
    values shown below.  Usually, it is best to use the short descriptions
    of mobiles and the names of players when speaking them, but if you are
    performing an action to someone almost always you want the name. The
    title field for players is an extra that probably wont often be used.
    Without further hesitation... the variables:

$i      the first word of the name of the mobile
$I      the short description of $i
$n      the name of the one who caused the trigger to happen
$N      the short description of $n
$t      the name of a secondary player target (example: $n smiles at $t)
$T      the short description of $t
$r      the name of a random player in the room
$R      the short description of $r

$e      he,she,it    based on sex of $n
$m      him,her,it   based on sex of $n
$s      his,hers,its based on sex of $n

$j      he,she,it    based on sex of $i
$k      him,her,it   based on sex of $i
$l      his,hers,its based on sex of $i

$E      he,she,it    based on sex of $t
$M      him,her,it   based on sex of $t
$S      his,hers,its based on sex of $t

$J      he,she,it    based on sex of $r
$K      him,her,it   based on sex of $r
$L      his,hers,its based on sex of $r

$o      the name of the primary object   (selected in give_progs)
$O      the short description of $o
$p      the name of the secondary object (example $n puts $o in $p)
$P      the short description of $p
$c      the name of a carried object     (select with hasobjnum check)
$C      the short description of $c

$a      a,an based on name of $o
$A      a,an based on name of $p

$1..$9  Corresponding word in the trigger phrase

    Also, in if_checks, the accepted variables are the basic ones
    (i,n,t,r).  If a variable is referenced that doesnt exist, then the value
    is simply left blank. (i.e referring to $o when the trigger is: A kisses B)

    The only problem with the variables is that the secondary object and
    the secondary target are passed by act() in the same location.  This
    means that if you reference $t in an  A puts B in C  situation, the
    result will probably be a wierd log file spam, espescially if $t is
    used in an if_check (if isnpc ($t) or something)

    The basic fix is to write the act_program such way that it can hardly
    go wrong for a very specific situation.

    Example: >act_prog p gives a stone of power to~

    $n is the one giving the stone.
    $t is the one receiving the stone.
    $O is the short description of the stone.

    You'll hardly need $o and $p though.

    $c and $C are very useful to store the name of a player so the mobile
    can refer to it later on.


------------------------------Control Flow Syntax------------------------------

    In place of any legal mud command in a MOBprogram, one can substitute a
    flow of control command. Here is the syntax for a flow of control command.

"if" " " {if_check_1} "(" {argument} ")" [ {operator} {value} ] NL
"or" " " {if_check_2} "(" {argument} ")" [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
                        .           .           .
"or" " " {if_check_N} "(" {argument} ")" [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]

  [ {program_command_1} NL ]
  [ {program_command_2} NL ]
         .   .   .
  [ "break" NL ]
         .   .   .
  [ {program_command_N} NL ]

[ "else" NL ]

  [ {program_command_1} NL ]
  [ {program_command_2} NL ]
         .   .   .
  [ "break" NL ]
         .   .   .
  [ {program_command_N} NL ]

"endif" NL

    Basically, it is: an 'if' line, followed by zero or more 'or' lines,
    followed by zero or more legal mud commands, which may contain a 'break'
    line, possibly followed by an 'else' line , followed by zero or more
    legal mud commands, which may contain a 'break' line, followed by an
    'endif' line.

    The only new syntax labels are all in the IF line:

--- Explainations

    An IF_CHECK is a string which describes how to compare things.
    The ARGUMENT is the target of the check.
    The OPERATOR indicates how the target and value are going to be compared.
    The VALUE is compared depending on the given operator.

    The BREAK command bails out of the entire MOBprogram regardless of the
    level if nesting.

    If that looks confusing, skip to the end of the document and review the
    Example. Hopefully that should clear things, otherwise you'll probably
    have to give us a mail since examples are the best way we know to
    explain syntax.


--------------------------------Operators-----------------------------------

    Most of the basic numeric operators are legal and perform the same
    function as in C. The string operators are a bit more confusing.

    There are negative versions of some of the operators. These are not
    strictly needed, since the if/else construct of Control Flow commands
    can handle either case.

    Numeric Operators: == != > < >= <=     String Operators: == != / !/

    For strings, == and != check for exact match between the two strings
    and the other two, / and !/ check to see if the second string is contained
    in the first one.  This is so things like:  if name($n) / guard  will
    respond true to "cityguard" "guard" "guardian"  etc. Using == on a name
    implies that you are matching the complete name "cityguard guard" or
    whatever.


------------------------If_Checks In Control Flow---------------------------

    The provided list of if_checks and their arguments are below.  They
    should all be fairly obvious in what they do, but some of the more
    obtuse deserve a slight explanation. Any '==' operator can be replaced
    with any of the available ones described above.  The argument ($*)
    refers to any of the variables which make sense for that if_check
    (i.e. for an if_check which is referencing a person the only valid
    variables would be $i, $n, $t or $r)

    A value type of string is a sequence of characters. It does not need to
    be included in quotes or anything like that
    (i.e. name($n)== orc large brown)

if rand   (number)                  Is rand percentage less or equal to number
if isnpc      ($*)                  Hardly used since most triggers only work
if ispc       ($*)                  on players
if isgood     ($*)
if isevil     ($*)
if isneutral  ($*)
if iskiller   ($*)
if isthief    ($*)
if isfight    ($*)                  Is $* fighting
if isfollow   ($*)                  Is $* a follower with master in same room
if hitprcnt   ($*)  == percent      Checks percentage of hitpoints left
if inroom     ($*)  == vnum
if isaffected ($*)  == bitvector
if sex        ($*)  == bitvector
if position   ($*)  == bitvector
if class      ($*)  == bitvector
if race       ($*)  == bitvector
if whichgod   ($*)  == bitvector
if level      ($*)  == integer
if goldamt    ($*)  == integer
if objtype    ($*)  == bitvector
if objval0    ($*)  == integer
if objval1    ($*)  == integer
if objval2    ($*)  == integer
if objval3    ($*)  == integer
if number     ($*)  == integer      Is the vnum of $* equal to integer
if name       ($*)  == string
if time       ()    == integer
if shotfrom   ($i)  == string       Used for range_prog
if objtype    ($*)  == bitvector

------------------------MOBCommands Of Interest-----------------------------

    These are fairly basic things, most of them are wiz commands which have
    been changed to allow for mobiles to perform the commands.  If you have
    the problem of immortals abusing these powers on your mud either ditch
    the immortals, or add a check in all of them to only let NPC's with null
    descriptors do the commands.  (However, you lose a little debugging help
    that way).  Emud has provided a little security feature against this but
    it is by no means comprehensive.  Please check yourself if you are
    concerned.

*** Important:
    Since many items have the same name for keywords, it is required
    for area creators to use the I#### system for such things as give_prog.
    This uses the object number with an 'I'.

    This method allows exact procedures of handling objects in mob_progs.
    This system is added to all item keywords, so it is not necessary to
    add them to each item keyword list.

    Here are the basic MOBcommands that we found to be enticing:

*** MPROG <mobile>

    Shows the MOBprograms which are set on the mob of the given name or
    vnum and some basic stats for the mobile

*** MPASOUND <text_string>

    Prints the text string to the rooms around the mobile in the same
    manner as a death cry. This is really useful for powerful aggressives
    and is also nice for wandering minstrels or mobiles like that in
    concept.


*** MPECHO                <text_string>
    MPECHOAT     <victim> <text_string>
    MPECHOAROUND <victim> <text_string>
    MPAREAECHO            <text_string>

    Prints the text message to the room of the mobile. Colors can be used.

    When executed by a player:
    $n will print the name of the executer. $e $s $m will show sex related
    stuff of the executer.

    When executed by a mobile program:
    See list with variables, they will work as described.


*** MPJUNK <object>

    Destroys the object refered to in the mobiles inven. It prints no
    message to the world and you can do mpjunk all to junk every item
    carried AND worn by the mobile in one time.


*** MPMLOAD <mobile vnum>
    MPOLOAD <object vnum>

    Loads the obj/mobile into the inven/room of the mobile. If the item is
    non-takable it will drop to the ground unseen.
    This lets a mobile distribute a quest item or load a key or something.
    Being an area quest orientated mud we don't make a problem out of
    loading, where other muds might.


*** MPKILL <victim>

    Lets a mobile kill a player. Lots of MOBprograms end up with mpkill $n
    commands floating around. It works on both mobiles and players.


*** PEACE

    This command comes in handy to stop a fight.  It also clears the
    hunting, hating, and fearing flags that might be upon a mobile.


*** SLAY <victim>

    This command simply kills the victim, this cannot be 'self'.  When
    a player is slayed they will not lose exp or have a death added.


*** QUIT

    When this command is executed by a mobile it will instantly die,
    leaving a corpse.


*** RESETAREA

    resetarea will result in an instant repop of the area the mobile is in.


*** MPPURGE <all|area|argument>

    Destroys the argument from the room of the mobile. With the 'all' argument
    the result is the cleansing of all NPC's and items from the room with
    the exception of the mobile itself.  However, mppurge self will indeed
    purge the mobile, but it MUST be the last command the mobile tries to
    do, otherwise the mud cant reference the acting mobile trying to do the
    commands and crash will happen. There are situations where this comes
    unwanted. Simply add a 'break' after the mppurge self , it will stop
    the program and the break itself won't cause any errors.
    mppurge area, will purges everything in the area, except the mob purging
    it.


*** MPQUIET  < 'ON', 'OFF'>

    This command stops ALL forms of out output data from reaching anyone.
    This command can be only used inside of mob_progs, and should not be
    used in obj_progs at any time (it will not work regardless).

    Simply issue 'mpquiet on' to make all commands quiet.  The mob_prog
    will always reset it to 'off' regardless is the programmer calls the
    'off'.  This command could be used to simulate a snake biting, when
    it is actually casting 'poison'.  Simply mpecho the bite, then turn
    MPQUIET ON and do the casting.


*** MPGOTO <dest>

    Moves the mobile to the room or mobile or object requested.  It makes
    no message of its departure or of its entrance, so these must be
    supplied with mpecho commands if they are desired.


*** MPAT <dest> <command>

    Perfoms the command at the designated location. The destination can
    be an object, room or player/mob.  It mainly saves some coding work
    since you won't need the mob to mpgoto <destination> + command +
    mpgoto <where mob came from> to get stuff done.


*** MPTRANSFER [<victim>, 'all', 'pcs'] [dest]

    Sends the victim to the destination or to the room of the mobile as a
    default.  if the victim is "all" then all the characters in the room
    of the mobile are transfered to the destination.  Good for starting
    quests or things like that.  There is no message given to the player
    that it has been transfered and the player doesnt do a look at the
    new room unless the mob forces them to. The mobile MUST be in the
    same room as the character being transfered before the transfer will
    take place.

    Please note that the use of "all" includes mobiles except one issuing
    the command.  Use "pcs" to transfer all players and pets. Try to use
    "pcs" as much as possible, unless you want to transfer mobs.


*** MPFORCE <victim, all> <command>

    Forces the victim to do the designated command.  The victim is not told
    that they are forced, they just do the command, mpquiet is oftenly used
    here so the player isn't aware when you force them to remove all there
    gear and sac it in a very naughty program. Again, if the victim is "all"
    then everyone in the mobiles room does the command.


*** MPMSET <victim> <field>  <argument>
*** MPMSET <victim> <string> <argument>

    Field being one of:
      level gold align thirst drunk full exp quest questr randquest randquestr
    String being one of:
      name short long title

    quest, questr, randquest, randquestr have additional parameters:

    mpmset <victim> quest                 <firstBit> <numBits> <newValue>
    mpmset <victim> questr     <areaVnum> <firstBit> <numBits> <newValue>
    mpmset <victim> randquest             <firstBit> <numBits>
    mpmset <victim> randquestr <areaVnum> <firstBit> <numBits>

    To make a diguise for a player, change the string of LONG to what you want
    to disguise the player as.  To return the player to it's normal state, use
    the value of NULL.

    Example:

    mpmset $n long There is a small boy here.
    (disguise the player as a small boy)
    mpmset $n long null
    (returns the player to normal)


*** MPMADD <victim> <field> <argument>

    Field being one of:
      level gold align thirst drunk full exp currhp currmana currmove
      hp mana move quest questr

    quest and questr have additional parameters:

    mpmadd <victim> quest             <firstBit> <numBits> <value>
    mpmadd <victim> questr <areaVnum> <firstBit> <numBits> <value>


*** MPOSET <object> <field>  <argument>
*** MPOSET <object> <string> <argument>

    Field being one of:
      value0 value1 value2 value3 extra setextra clrextra wear level weight
      cost timer quest randquest
    String being one of:
      name short long ed

    quest and randquest have additional parameters:

    mposet <object> quest     <firstBit> <numBits> <newValue>
    mposet <object> randquest <firstBit> <numBits>


*** MPOADD <object> <field> <argument>

    Field being one of:
      value0 value1 value2 value3 level weight cost timer quest

    quest has additional parameters:

    mpoadd <object> quest <firstBit> <numBits> <value>


*** MPASET <object> <field> <argument>

    Field being one of:
      str dex int wis con mana hp move ac damroll hitroll
      para rod petri breath spell

    This command allows you to permanently add affects to objects.


*** MPGORAND <firstroom> <lastroom> <offset> <skipsize>

    say, you have a 4x4 area from room #6400 to #6415 arranged like:

        6400 6401 6402 6403
        6404 6405 6406 6407
        6408 6409 6410 6411
        6412 6413 6414 6415

    mpgorand 6400 6415 0 4
    would put the mobile in 1 of the the following rooms: 6400 6404 6408 6412

    mpgorand 6400 6415 3 4
    would put the mobile in 1 of the the following rooms: 6403 6407 6411 6415


*** MAZE <X size> <Y size> <Z size> <Character Name>

    This command takes an area that already exists, and redefines the exits
    into a random pattern.  This can be used to create mazes that change
    during game play.  This command is very slow, so use with caution.
    The maze that is created has absolutely no connections to the rest of the
    world, so the use of "connect", "doorset" and "key" may be required to
    link the area to the rest of the game.

    <? size> defines the dimensions of the maze.

    <Character Name> defines what the seed number will be.

    Seed number is a value that determines how the maze will be generated.
    The use of the same seed on a maze with the same dimensions will always
    generate the same maze.  Therefore individuals will always see the same
    maze, but it will be different between individuals.

    Example:

    maze 3 2 4 $n

    Creates a maze that has 24 rooms, with a seed based on $n's vnum.
    NOTE: The name is a good place for '$n' of the mob_progs.


*** CONNECT <direction> <roomVnum> [both]

    This command creates a hallway in one direction from the current room
    to the room described in the destination.

    <direction> defines which door the exit is generated at.
                Use: north, east, south, west, up, down

    <roomVnum>  defines the number of the room connecting to.

    Use a destination number of "-1" to create a wall, and disconnect a room.

    [both] is an optional parameter that creates a bi-directional hallway.
           Without this option, the hallway created it totaly one-way.

    Example:

    connect north 9755 up

    Creates a connection between the current room and roterodamum square.

    Usage:

    An interesting use for this command is to temporarily create a door that
    did not previously exist, and force a party through it, then use the
    connect command again to remove the newly created eixt.


*** DOORSET <direction> <doorflag> <doorname>

    The doorflag must have a value between 0 and 47 (needs an update we know)
    The doorname will automatically become the exit description

    Every key with value0 being 0 will unlock the created door

    Current plans will result in the following change in the future:

    doorset <direction> <field> <argument>

      Field being one of:
        name desc flag key

    This command places a door between two connected rooms.  These rooms need
    not be connected through the "connect" command.  If you are using the
    "connect" command, be sure to connect both sides, since the "connect"
    command only works in one direction.  The door command only works if both
    exits on the two rooms are going in opposite directions, to the other room,
    which is a standard hallway.

    <direction> defines which door the exit is generated at.
                Use: north, east, south, west, up, down

    <flag>      is the door flag:

                0 - no door
                1 - door
                2 - closed
                4 - locked
                8 - hidden
               32 - pickproof
               64 - bashproof
              128 - magicproof

    Example: These are for the future version of doorset:

    doorset north name gate
    (sets the keyword of the door to: gate)

    doorset north desc You see heavy iron gates blocking your path.
    (sets the exit description)

    doorset north flag 167
    (sets exit flags to: magicproof, pickproof, locked, closed, door)

    doorset north key 3714
    (the door can be unlocked by the item with vnum 3714, the key from
     the tower of training in this case)


*** RESCALE <mobVnum> <target> <percentage>

The level, damage, and hitpoints of the mobile will be rescaled

Formula: newLevel = mobLevel * targetLevel/100 * percentage/100

*** PURGE AREA

    This command is a modified form of MPPURGE, called by "purge area".
    When used it scans every room in an entire area, and purges it of items
    and mobiles.

*** MPSWAP <direction1> <direction2>

    This command will swap the given directions. It works easier than
    disconnecting and reconnecting exits, and should be useful if you
    want to create your own mazes.

--------------------------Regarding CPU Slowdown-------------------------------

    We have no real idea how slow this makes a mud. However, you will find
    that if you are judicious with your use of MOBprograms, you can either
    do little damage, or even reduce the effort on your server!

    This means that mobile rand_progs shouldn't be used when a time_prog will
    do just as well. (A time prog is checked once a mud day, which is about
    once every 1 minuts, instead of every second)

    Include proper if checks to avoid too much code needing execution.

    Include a $r if the program only needs execution with a player being in
    the same room.

    Try to keep the percentage low when the rand prog is just for fun and
    isn't required for good functioning of the quest.


    Emud systems can track the average speed for various functions.  Mobile
    programs rank as one of the top 3 functions, and eat up about 25% of the
    total cpu usage for the entire game.  Although this is a general game-wide
    value, it gives an idea of the complexity of the mob_prog system. Even
    though computer hardware gets better and better it's still a good habbit
    to make your programs as cpu friendly as possible.


-------------------------Miscellaneous Information-----------------------------

    There is really no limit to the number of MOBprograms a given mobile
    can have. However, the length of a single command block is limited by the
    value of MAX_STRING_LENGTH.  In my version it was around 22k, so that is
    probably about 500 lines.  The indentation spaces shown in the example
    make it easier to read (and debug), and since your programs will be
    checked by an admin it would be wise to use them.

    The MOBprogram stuff runs totally without anything in the mob_commands.c
    file, but letting mobiles be a bit more godlike has allowed us to do what
    we consider to be wonderful things. The replicant and polymorphing mobiles
    described above as well as some nifty mob helping mob interactions are an
    example.

    It IS possible to accidentally make mobiles which can trigger in
    loops. As mentioned in the example at the end of this document, the
    result is usually a mud crash or major CPU dent.  We dont know any way
    to prevent this from happening, other than careful coding and a
    restriction of mobile travel from zones of one creator to another
    (another good reason to not have charmed mobiles do anything).
    Tracking down the culprit mobile is not always easy.  The only thing we
    have found which always works, is to add a log statement into the
    MOBprogram driver and fill some disk space until it becomes apparent
    what commands are repetitively issued. Also, most infinite loops are
    flukes where the situation just happens to be right and usually it never
    happens again.

    Another common problem is mobiles that load other mobiles for various
    reasons.  This may seem innoculous, until the loaded mobile decides to
    load another mobile.  It has been seen that some areas, over the course
    of time can develope thousands of mobiles, which slow down the cpu
    drastically, not to mention the drain on system resources, such as RAM.
    Be very careful that you know the exact situation before mpmloading
    another mobile.

    The list of variables and triggers and if_checks will grow continuously
    as our creators demand the ability to do certain things.  If you have a
    request or if you have a new one, we don't mind hearing about them,
    and if you find bugs, we shall gladly attempt to squash them for you. As
    additions or fixes are made, the code will occasionally be redistributed.

    However, if you want a current version, please feel free to ask. When the
    code is redistributed, a file containing the change history from the
    original release will be provided (when possible) to allow you to patch
    in the changes with low grief.

*** Note about testing:

    All area creators are required to test their area thoroughly before
    it is included in the working game.  This is usually done on a test game,
    where the implementors of the working game run the test game on a
    part-time basis.

    Special note should be taken on all mob_progs, and obj_progs.  It is
    absolutely required that all cases of a program must be tested, even if
    it is a simple failure to break.  It is much better to find program bugs
    in the test game then in the working game.


----------------------------------Credits-----------------------------------

    The reason this code was written was to enhance the playing experience at
    ThePrincedom (a Merc 2.0 based world scheduled to open in October 1993)

    The original idea for this type of MOBprogram came from playing on:
    WORLDS of CARNAGE, a dikumud implemented by Robbie Roberts and Aaron Buhr.

    Aaron (known as Dimwit Flathead the First) was the original author from
    what I have been told, and I hope he will not be totally offended and
    angered by my coding and sharing a mimicked version with the world. This
    version is probably not as good as the original and I do feel remorse for
    publishing the idea. However, since Carnage has been down for months
    without a word of information regarding its return, I am glad to let one
    of the best features live on in future generations of MUDs.

    There are no objections to this code being shared, since, aside from
    a nuclear destruction of all the Temples of Midgaard (excepting the
    original one!!), bland mobiles are the greatest bane of Dikumuds today.
    It would be nice to get a message saying you are using the code just for
    our references. We shant answer questions from anyone until told where
    they are using the code. *grin*  Since this code is not copyrighted, you
    of course dont have to do anything we say, but it would be nice of you to
    put the mobprog help screen into your database. and have mobinfo show up
    somewhere on a more visable help screen (possibly tagged onto the bottom
    of credits as a see also...)

    I acknowledge all the work done by the original Diku authors as well as
    those at Merc Industries and appreciate their willingness to share code.
    Also, quick thanks to Wraith for doing a little beta-installation testing.

    N'Atas-Ha                                                       June, 1993

    In addition to this DOC file credit section, I'd like to add a thank you
    to Yaz, Mahatma, Zelda, and the rest of the Marble Mud crew for extensively
    testing MOBProgram 2.1 for me.  You may see MOBPrograms in action as well
    as their own "flavor" of mud at marble.bu.edu 4000.

Just a tasteless gloating statement by Chaos:

    A major advancement to the operation of mob_progs was introduced October
    of 1995.  This major advancement is the tokenizing of mob_progs.  The
    original code was a simple system that parsed the code for the $n stuff
    and shoved the result into the interp routine.  This is the same interp
    routine that players use to decipher commands.  The interp routine is
    relatively slow, and the mob_prog parser is quite slow itself.  The basis
    of the tokenizer is that a mob_prog will not change, once the mud itself
    has started up, so why parse and interperet it with every execution of a
    mob_prog?

    The basic system parses and interperets the mob_progs at boot time.
    During the execution of a mob_prog, the entire program is made up of
    pointers to tokens, or blocks of binary (not ascii) data.  Execution time
    is improved significantly.

    Additional, the wiz command mprog displays the mob_prog's input,
    displaying the mob_prog's output.  This means that the command shows
    what the mud understands from the mob_prog given to it.  Which is
    excellent for debugging.  Also the TIMEMODE command in active mode will
    give a trace output of the mob_progs while they execute, including the
    mob_prog line numbers.  Future efforts may give these commands to the
    players on the testing game.

>act_prog p pokes you in the~
if isnpc ($n)
  chuckle
  poke $n
else
  if level ($n) <= 5
  or isgood ($n)
    tell $n I would rather you didnt poke me.
  else
    if level ($n) > 15

      say Ya know $n. I hate being poked!!!

    endif

Ok.. time to translate.. the trigger will only happen when the mobile
gets the message "... pokes you in the ..." If the offender (recall
the $n and $N refer to the char who did the poking...) is an NPC, then
the mobile merely chuckles and pokes back. If the offender was a PC
then good and low level characters get a warning, high level chars
get attacked, and midlevel chars get slapped and whined at.

Note that two of these mobiles could easily get into an infinite poke
war which slows down (or frequently crashes) the mud just a bit..
Be very careful about things like that if you can. (i.e dont respond
to a poke with a poke, and try not to let heavily programmed robot mobiles
wander around together. More on that is given above.)

Also, it is clear that the 'order' command could get confused with the 'or'
control flow. However, this is only the case when 'order' is abbreviated to
its two letter form, and placed immediately following an 'if' line. Thus,
if you want to be that malicious in trying to break the MOBprogram code,
noone is going to stand in your way (However, the result of this would be
a bug message and a bail out from the ifcheck so things dont really break)

sizes, and colors.  You can hear the buzzing of bees as they fly and
pollenate the blooms.  The birds chirp and all is happy in this quiet
garden.

Inside the garden~
Many fresh and fragrant flowers grow in this section of the garden.  A wide
variety of colors fill the entire area, as do a swarm of pollenating bees.
You hope you do not aggravate them enough that they attack.

West of the garden center~
You stand west of the garden fountain.  Many weeds cover the floor here, as
if no one tends this section of the garden.  You really feel like pulling
them out, as they are quite unsightly.

One room east of the center of the garden~
You are now east of the center of this colorful garden.  Unfortunately,
many weeds have sprouted up and ruin the beauty of this path.  Perhaps you
could kill some.

A corner of the garden~
In this dark area of the garden, a few dark evil looking trees grow.  They
seem to shake and move, as if they are trying to get you.  Perhaps it is
just your imagination, or perhaps the trees really are alive.

A dark grove of trees~
The trees here look very strange compared to other normal trees.  These
look dark and evil, unlike the normal trees of the holy grove.  They aren't
fully grown however, merely saplings.

West end of the garden~
You come to the end of the garden.  Many tall trees block any further

everywhere.

A dark grove of tress~
Many sickly baby trees grow here.  They are void of leaves, which have long
since dropped off of them and onto the ground.  The leafless branches look
quite eerie, and you can imagine them moving as they sway in the wind.

Many flowers bloom here, but the weeds which grow here as well ruin the
natural beauty of the flower garden.  You do notice a few bees flying
around drinking nectar from the blossoms.

You are now wandering south of the center of the garden.  Many giant weeds
