                          The Alchemist's Workshop
{300}
The Alchemist's Workshop can be found by going east on the stream south of the
gnome village.  Be prepared to talk to the mobs and write down the clues that
they give you (there are too many to remember).  Words in all caps are likely
to be good conversation starters.

Do not trust the hints given to you by other PCs because the clues and the
solutions to quests will vary from person to person.  Be prepared to use your
brain a little bit if you want to learn how to make gold and enter the guild
of Alchemists.

  say to them. I will give you one more hint. I am the
  say sixth and final Lord Alchemist of the line. My tomb
  say awaits me in the crypt.  Traditionally the heir to
  say the alchemist knowledge layed his master to rest.

Inscribed on one face is the Alchemist's Creed:

    The alchemist will always strive to protect the
    secrets of the guild.

It also mentions the ability to use a command called "BAR" that will
enable you to create a gold bar worth 100,000 coins from the gold you
carry on your person. On the other side is a portrait of Nicosia, whom
everyone knows as the first Queen of the Tregganu Dynasty who united the
seven historic tribes of the gnomes to defend their homeland in the
Lampertium Wars.

Health Warning:

It has been found that the furnace golem has been releasing a great deal
of fumes during its operation.  A request has been placed for a repair-
gnome to fix this small problem.  In the meantime, it is suggested that
anyone using the furnace eat a large piece of bread covered with lots of
butter to lessen the effect of the fumes.  The management  does not want
to see a repeat of the BERTHOLLET incident (see memo #67).

As you enter you are overpowered by the burning smell of brimstone and
rotten eggs. Incense burners are working overtime in the four corners of
the room creating the haze.  Through the smoky gloom you can see a small
straw pallet and a flea ridden blanket.  Sitting on the blanket is a
forlorn old man. At first he looks at you sternly, but then his eyes
soften and he beckons you forward. You can exit to the south through the

Chinese Wisdom:

     Gold is incorruptible and therefore the most valuable of things.
The men of Art, feeding on it attain longevity...hoary hair regains it
blackness and new teeth grow where fallen ones used to be.  If an old man,
he will once more become a youth.  If an old woman, she will regain her
maidenhood.  Such transformations make one immune from worldly miseries.

The attic is one open room stacked to the rafters with the accumulated
junk of several generations of researchers.  It functioned as a library
of sorts, but without any organization.  In the past it would have taken
weeks to find anything here.  Now files and cabinets have been torn open.
Papers and empty sample vials are spread all over the area. A strange
green light filters through the wreckage of the room.  You can walk
south or west.

It reads:
My dear fellow seeker,
    Here is the mystery:  the serpent Ouroboros, this composition which
in its ensemble is devoured and melted, dissolved, and transformed by the
fermentation or putrefaction.  It becomes a deep green and the color of
gold is derived from it. It is from it that is derived the red called the
color of cinnabar.  This is the cinnabar of the philosophers.  Its stomach
and back are the color of saffron, its head is a deep green.  Its four
feet constitute the tetrasomie. Its three ears are the three sublimed
vapors.  The One furnishes the Other its blood and the One gives birth to
the Other: nature rejoices in nature;  and that not for a nature opposed
to such another nature but for one and the same nature proceeding of
itself by the process with trouble and great effort.  But thou, my dear
friend, apply thy intelligence to these matters and thou wilt not fall
into error;  but work seriously, and without negligence, until thou hast
seen the end.  A serpent is stretched guarding this temple and he who has
subdued it commences by sacrificing it, then roasts it, and after removing
its flesh up to the bones makes of it a step to the entrance of the
temple.  Mount upon it and thou shalt find the object sought, for the
priest at first a man of copper has changed color and nature and has
become a man of silver; a few days later, if thou wish, thou wilt find
him changed to a man of gold.

                       Bolos of Mendes


A glowing note is attached to the bottom which reads:

     Please follow my friend Bolos' instructions carefully in preparing
your gold.  He has been very kind to explicitly spell out the process of
transmutation for us.  Follow his instructions very carefully.

It reads:

Amorgo's Numerology of Annihilation.

>From out of the pit of Orusteous come the five disciples of malevolence.
The first is the jackal sporting green stockings.  The twelve toes of the
jackal are the various effluvium of the purple invertebrate overlord.
The second disciple is the red saw grass of wretchedness whose sorrow is
the sorrow of the damned.  The third to appear is the blue oleum beast.
Its four spigots of desperation, destitution, desolation and despoliation
disgorge the fantasies of the three Sulwesi Witches. The fourth is the
Orange Reblochon of Tessera whose six bourgeois conspirators make up the
council of Sorbiodunum.  Woe be to the being who crosses the two-fold
threshold of her shrine in the Tuomotu Mountains.  The last is the Golden
Alpaca. In the beginning of the universe was the pledge and the pledge was
the Alpaca and the pledge encompassed the whole world.  On the day of the
Annihilation, five disciples will range across the land;  five disciples
will probe the souls of the evanescent world; only four disciples will
deliver the Hudibrastic Chimera into the hands of the Quezalten Slayer.
The Golden One will return to the pit and leave the world to its fate
unless the Ancient Crown of the Gnome Empire is returned to the
Onychophoran Troglodyte.

Combine the wing of a large bat, golden dust and distilled water and in a
large tub.  After one hour (the mixture having turned a dark blue if done
correctly) green slime is added.  After a long period of effervescence,
the residue is collected and recrystallized from grain alcohol to give
the final product which is highly valued by the people who dwell in the
Plains of Viliot.

This shop has never seen better days.  It appears to have been thrown
together very quickly with no thought of the ambiance.  It is dirty, drab
and disorganized.  Foul smelling yellow fumes leak out from under the door
to the north. Shelves containing many differently sized bottles and jars
line the walls.  Some contain liquids, some powders, and some the pickled
bodies of miscellaneous creatures; in whole or in part.  A surly young
gnome works the counter, if that is what you call what he is doing.  He
spends most of his time picking his teeth.  If you put up a fuss, he might
show you the items for sale.  A sign hangs on the wall.  You can exit to

The Barren Hills~
It is difficult to see very far through the smog.  Something in the air is
irritating your lungs. Where could it be coming from?  A single purple stone
lies on the ground here. You can proceed north, south, east or west.

On the Stream~
The stream is cold and frigid, yet it supports plenty of life beneath its
surface.  A trickle of water comes from a crack in a rock face to the east
and flows west.To the south is an embankment that you cannot climb.
A small path leads away from the stream to the north.
