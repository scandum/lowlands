The area has been deisgned to add a different factor in the life of characters
on the game. You will have the chance to choose 3 different quests, so almost
anyone will be able to find the one that they will enjoy more. Each of the 3
quests has been based on the choice on one of three gods. Once you choose one,
you will be bound to it forever and in order to maintain the advantages of it
you must stay within certain limitations on your behaviour. If you dont follow
these rules, you'll loose control of your gains without any chance of getting 
them back. To have more informations on each of the quests, keep on checking 
the helps.

{308}
The quest for Vishnu is pretty hard and might take a long time, depending if
you manage to find certain hints that are hidden somewhere. The equipment you
will receive as a prize has been created only for people with good alignment,
thus going under align 350 would result in the complete loss of it. It has been
built for spellcasters in general.

The quest for Shiva is pretty hard and might take a long time, depending if
you manage to find certain hints that are hidden somewhere. The equipment you
will receive as a prize has been created only for people with evil alignment,
thus going above align -350 would result in the complete loss of it. It has

{308}
The quest for Brahama is easier than the other two but has more requirements
to be started. If you want to do it you have to be neutral alignment. The
equipment given was designed by me for shamans.

{308}
My most sincere thanks to some guys who play or used to play Mortal Realms.
They are: Chaste, Panic, Deadbolt, Redrum, Calamir and Blackstaff.
The area was based on a personal review of the hindu religion, philosophy
and mythological entities, I apologize if it offends anyone's sensibility but
it is just a part of a game.

90 RIVERWARNINGS~

                                   Warning
{308}
1 You can accomplish only 1 of the 3 quests. If unfortunately, after
  finishing one of them, you cant manage to stay inside the align restrictions
  you will not have a second chance to switch to another quest.
2 All the equipment given at the end of quests is level 90 but it is flagged
  inventory, nodrop and noremove. This makes it exactly like a God-chain thus
  once you wear it there will be no chance to remove it.
3 Although you cant take it off your body, you have a chance to destroy any
  piece of the equipment. If you destroy you will not have a chance to have
  that piece of equipment back.
4 Being all the eq like God-chains it cant be handed out, so you have to make
  the quest by yourself.

tell $n finished my duties and reached Vishnu himself, but once
tell $n I talked to him I realized that the true power wasnt
tell $n lying neither in Vishnu's nor in Shiva's hands. At that
tell $n time I decided to retire and leave in close contact

tell $n Brahama can be. Since then I have been one of his most

book path~
the Path to Shiva~
A book lies on the floor here.~
This book contains the things one man must keep in mind to reach Shiva's soul.
1. Enter a state of mind where nothing you can do can save you from
your destiny.
2. Whenever you feel in danger trust in Shiva's powers.
3. Sisters and brothers dont mean anything. Everyone is equal.
4. Nobody and nothing will ever reach Shiva's powers of destruction.
5. Who tries to challenge Shiva, either will meet his fate or will join him
as an undead.
6. Shiva's deadly force is what keeps the world alive and dying.
7. Enlightened Shiva's priests refer directly to their God, thus they must
be considered almost as powerful as Shiva.
8. Who wants to be his servant must ask to the High Priest in the temple.
9. Never aid someone dying, if not by killing him sending his soul to feed
Shiva.
10. When you think Shiva has enlightened you, think twice and restart your
journey.
On the back of the book there is a picture of Shiva.

picture shiva~
Shiva is represented here with 3 heads: on one side the feminine face,
symbolizing the creator, on the opposide side the masculine face of the
devastator, and in the middle the apathethic visage of Shiva maintaining his
creation. Each of his four arms is holding four different items: one holds
a tamburine, symbolizing sound, one is raised in an effort to maintain world
together, one holds an axe, symbol of disruption, and the fourth one holds
the fire. Shiva keeps his feet on Nandi the White Bull worshipped by Vishnu's
followers.

the History of Visnhu- Book One~
A book lies on the floor here.~
Vishnu is the God of benevolence. He often took a material shape and intervened
into the realm of the mortals to help someone or a population in danger. His
many adventures are narrated in the many volumes of his history. This part
explains the teologic part. Vishnu is the creator of space and time, (since
he measured the whole world in three steps.). His followers strongly believe
in his superior powers, thinking that the god in his immensity embraces every
part of the universe.

book~
the History of the Holy River~
A book lies on the floor here.~
This book explains how this land is organized. There currently are 3 different
religions, each of them worships a different god. What defines which religion
to follow is the alignment, so: good people worship Vishnu on the right bank
of the river, evil people trust in Shiva and live on the west bank of the
river, while neutral people follow the beliefs of Brahama. Very few people
trust in Brahama, and it's currently believed that the religion died for a lack
of followers. Once you join one of the three religions you will be bound to it
for the rest of your life, there are no circumstances that will allow you to
betray the beliefs you chose to live in. Trust in your God will end up giving
you great powers but, as soon as your faith will fail, you'll loose all your
gainings and you will become a paria, for the people living on the river
banks. All the 3 religions have several degrees, although it is believed that
Brahama decided to make things simpler for the lack of followers.

A book lies on the floor here.~
Many are the mantras written on this book, and they all are indicated to be
useful to manipulate the rewards Shiva gives to His High Priests. Words are:
'ratumara', 'doscu', 'lanoel', 'telnomal', 'vitoste', 'loclera', 'raccalebi',
'micanhe', 'balimga', 'gatuni', 'ratunci', 'carabile', 'valitsi', 'melo'.
The Mantras have all been written in a mirrored way, so that by each of them,
there is the opposite of the same word. Maybe you can figure out what this means.
Within the book it is also described a ritual to be performed at the sacrifial
pit of the templt to obtain a pretty powerful object from the skull of a lich.
To accomplish the ritual the Priest only has to drop the skull of a lich into
the pit, reciting the following words:
Forces of the Deads, fill this Skull with your infinite powers.
The skull will come out enchanted.

panic statue~
the Statue of Panic~
The statue of Panic, a mighty ranger rests here.~
This is the statue of Panic. Panic was a great pure ranger who once roamed the
realms, those who have met him know how pure his soul was. Nothing was
corrupted in him, no struggle for power for him, no efforts to reach an elite
position. He sure was the right example to follow to become the perfect mud
player. Unfortunately many things that happened in this world led him to
other places, leaving all of us without a guide and hopelessly lost in an
ocean of arrogance and selfishness. I still hope that he will come back!
The sick boy wanted me to give him insane eq that could not be taken by people
too proud of themselves to have only normal eq, but I am quite insane as well,
but most of all I am hopelessly lazy, thus, I will not fulfill his stupid
desires. If you ever read this, I hope that, whoever you are, you will stop
for a minute and think about yourself and your attitude towards other players.
Have a Nice Day!
Fizzo.

A Little Lake~
This is where the Holy River comes from. The lake isnt very big, actually you
wouldnt even call it a lake. You dont see where the water enters the lake
though; you decide not to think about it, and look around yourself. The
surroundings here are very nice, a lot of trees, green grass, butterflies
flying around, it probably would be the perfect place to build a retirement
house. The river flows to the south.

not a positive religion. The people coming in and out of the gates wear black

some interesting some not. Many places at the tables are occupied by normal

This is a simple cloth shop, there arent many interesting goods to buy,
actually most of the stuff being sold consists in simple cloths; obviously not

This is a rather characteristic local. There are several tables and on some
of them is sitting someone who is enjoying Fizzo's extremely well cooked
dishes and specialties... Everyone in the Restaurant is happy to be in here
and feel happy too since you are surrounded by so many nice people.
A big and mean looking man comes towards with a suspicious grin.
As he gets near he says 'LEAVE YOUR WEAPONS OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT...
WE DONT WANT TROUBLES HERE... ;)'
As he said so he smiles and walks away. You think that it would be a
respectful act to this friendly people to go outside and drop weapons and
you do so...

You wonders how it feels to live completely deditcated to a religous cause,
and drop your thoughts soon after. To the East you see the main hallway of the

this population since they are not allowed to get milk from cows by their
religion, since they are considered sacred. The smell of this place invites you
to try out something. There is a small plaque on the desk of the shop. The
