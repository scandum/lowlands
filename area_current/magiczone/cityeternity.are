{308}
The City of Eternity, unlike the Magic Zone, is almost purely my work. When I
say this, I mean that I borrowed very little from books and/or movies. In any
case, there are few, if any references to Robert Jordan, David Eddings,
L.E. Modesitt, or Mercedes Lackey (there is one reference to her Valdemar
books). But they still rock. *grin* I hope that you enjoy the area!

-1 CITYETERNITY1~
{138}                                  The Story
{308}
In times long past, there was a rather ordinary looking crossroads. Just your
average, everyday dusty crossing. Then, late one misty night, just as the moon
reached its peak in the star-dusted sky, thin tendrils of energy began to
appear. They reached out, and tapped into long-buried ley lines.  The power
began to flow back to the strange, wierd light that began to glow in the night.

Suddenly, the light stretched, becoming a fifteen foot high slash in the very
fabric in time and space. A lone figure hurtled through the dimensional rift,
bolts of some energy unknown to this world flew after him, turning some of the
nearby rocks to slag. The figure leapt to its feet and spun around to face the
rift. He (for the figure was a male of some race) began to intone a spell in
a sonorous voice. The rift began to close rapidly. One of the things that had
been pursuing the man lunged at its intended victim. The rift closed on
the thing, slicing it in half. Even the intense crackling of mage-energies
was drowned out by the shriek of pain, rage and despair of the thing. As
the journeyman mage who had been sleeping nearby looked on in horrified
awe, the figure raised his hand, unleashing a massive blast of power upon
his enemy. The young mage started to back away, falling on his backside in
the process.

He knew only one thing. That power had *not* been any sort of magic.
The newcomer spun around and spotted the young journeyman, who had a very
frightened look on his face. The man began to howl with laughter. "What's so
damned funny?!", the mage spluttered furiously. The man replied, "The look on
your face! And it's just my luck...the first blind rift I make in over a
milleniium, and I land on my face in front of a mage..." The mage now saw
the man's face clearly. He was definitely human, but he had the face of a
young man, with eyes that looked like they held the wisdom of the ages.

As the man looked at the mage curiously, he asked, "What are you doing in
the middle of nowhere at this time of night, anyways?" "I'm seeking my
fortune." "A noble goal, my young friend," replied the fellow. With a
thoughtful look, he said, "May I come with you? I seek knowledge in all
its forms...and I'm pretty good in a fight." Thus, the partnership between
a mage known as the traveller known as Hunter came into being. Eventually
they founded this great city, which even to this day sits upon a lake.

Once the city and its many protections, mundane and magical, were in
place, Lord Hunter left to build his Tower, where to this day, he works on
many wonderful and amazing things.

corpses? It's freezing in here...

A small, seedy tavern~
This tavern is definitely on the cramped side.  The ceiling is low, and the
place is lit by some small, dim lanterns and mage lights.  The smell of cheap
liquor, smoke, greasy food, and cheap perfume.  Of all the bars, taverns, pubs,
and flophouses you have been in, this one is very close to the bottom of the
list. It's amazing that a city as wonderful as this could have
such a...a...sewer of society in it.

There are not as many people here, and the light is bad.  The funny thing is,
that you would think that the *further* from the door, the more people there
would be.  The furniture is in better condition, yet the only people here are
drunks, for the most part.  Wait!  Was that a movement in the corner?

You are standing in a dark, crowded cellar.  There are casks of ale and jugs
of liquor piled high in here.  Crates of assorted items line the walls, and the
entire place smells of wood, some dust, alcohol, and other, less pleasant,
smells.  You do not like the thought of trying to make a light in here to
dispel the gloom.  The faint dripping you hear is probably water. But it
*could* be alcohol, and lighting *that* could be more than a little
unpleasant.

The study which you have sought is strangely incongruent with the decor of the
rest of this part of town.  This room looks like it has been teleported right
out of a palace.  Opulent is the word that comes to mind as you gaze upon the
rich paintings and tapestries that hang in this room.  The room is splendidly
well-lit.  One painting in particular catches your eye.

This isn't a painting. . .not exactly.  It appears to be a customized throwing
knife target. The image that graces this target is none other than your friend,
Sir James!  A fancy dagger--with a richly jewelled hilt, and a pommelstone to
kill for--protrudes from between James' eyes. Hmm. . .no wonder James couldn't
get in here, not if he wanted to come out alive, and in one piece.

A shadowy alley~
This is a dark alley, scarcely six feet wide.  What is not plunged in darkness
is shadowed. The really peculiar thing about the situation is the fact that no
one on the street seems to even notice that this alley even exists.  Assorted
litter clutters the alley, making silent movement next to impossible.  There
almost seems to be some sort of hole in one of the larger piles in the back.

There's hardly enough room for you to manuever in here.  There is a pervasive
stench of decay coming from somewhere.  A large rat skitters out from

that you have ever seen in your life disappearing into a hole in the wall.
Hey! Is that a light that you see up ahead?

You are in a dimly lit area.  While other parts of the City of Eternity seem to
be crowned in shining light, this place seems to be cloaked in shadows, and the
light is dim indeed. Other, darker places come to mind--the Darkside in fallen
Thalos; the famed Sharthea which lies in ruins; Death Alley in that place of
Order, Mount Kolvir--and even though this place has a ways to go before it
reaches that level of decay, things certainly are heading that way.

Whatever this stuff is, it is exceptionally durable.  A small date that
appears to be embedded in the middle of the stuff claims that this cover was
made about two thousand years ago, yet it looks like it was made just
yesterday.  There is something else that you notice about the grate, now that
you see it from this side. . .no water is getting through it!
