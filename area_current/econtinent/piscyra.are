{308}
The rumours of the existance of a floating city somewhere to the north
of the eastern continent of the realms have been around for years,
though, as is the nature with folklore, the facts have become blurred with
time and the telling.  The most reliable report comes from an old hermit
who makes his home on the beach north of Olympus in a small shack
constructed of dessicated whale bone and driftwood.  In a short interview
we had over a sandpit-fried squid, he spoke to me in moments of lucidity
punctuated by manic laughter.  He told a tale of a prosperous slave trade
presided over by a foul pirate, whose ship holds are full of mushroom
women and children.  He also spoke of a band of refugees from an island
paradise who were driven to the sea by a huge turquoise wave which sunk
their island and the reefs around it.  Some say it was fate, some say it
was Lord Neptune, but there is no doubt that this island sunk into an
abyss, taking most of its population with it.  The few survivors of this
catastrophe used their advanced technological knowledge to construct a
walled city in the middle of the sea, where their descendents still live
today.  Shortly after the interview, the hermit stripped off his crusty
leather loincloth and ran away, screaming and laughing, down the beach.

On the Beach~
You are standing on a wind-swept beach.  Some dessicated
seaweed has putrified in the hot sun, marking the advance
of the tides up the steep, sandy slope.  The bleached bones
of an old whale carcass jut from the sand, a monument to
the rhythm of life at the boundary of sea and land.  There
is a sign here.

The Lagoon~
The green water is warm and salty, and just as you begin to drift off into
euphoria, you realize that a rather strong current is dragging you through a
narrow channel out to sea.  You wince as you glance off a sea urchin tucked
away in the rocks.

The Lagoon~
Tiny fish tickle your navel as you swim into the ever-deepening lagoon.
Brain coral has established itself in large islands, and the ripples in
the sand at the bottom of the lagoon cast strange striped shadows which
remind you of fine Elven cloth.  You look up just in time to realize that
you are being carried out to sea through a narrow channel by a strong
current.

The Narrow Channel~
Sand-covered coral crops out on both sides as the powerful current carries
you relentlessly out to sea.  Sea urchins cling tenously just below the
surface of the water, and schools of larger fish feed on nutrients carried
from the lagoon.

The Narrow Channel~
The water sweeps you past a row of small breakers which threaten to spear
you on the spines of the large urchins clinging to the rocks in this hostile
setting.  High spires of dead coral rise above you on either side, and the
deep blue sea extends all the way to the northern horizon.

Atop the Barrier Island~
You have climbed up on a sandy island which seperates the lagoon from the
deep blue sea to the north.  A huge line of breakers, three or four
whitecaps deep, speak of dangerous undertow and riptides that would make
travel to the north unadvisable.  As you turn to return the way you came,
you notice a small shack constructed of driftwood.

Rolling waves lap gently at the mammoth iron-plated walls which jut out of
the depths at a shocking angle.  Here, two walls come together to form a
sharp corner, though know rivet marks can be discerned, at least from your

The Sheltered Harbor~
You are inside the forbidding walls of the floating city.  The water in
this artificial, protected harbor is glassy and calm, disturbed only by
your boat as you scrape along the base of the walls.  A series of rickety
docks lies directly to the north.

The Sheltered Dock~
You stand upon a rickety dock made, evidently, from whatever wood could be
scavenged from the surrounding realms.  The floor of the home above your
head acts as a roof, giving some protection from the elements. The marina
extends to the east, and a ladder made from dried kelp leads through a small
hole to the room above.

You stand upon a rickety dock made, evidently, from whatever wood could be

shop of some sort, for the ceiling is hung with a number of curios and
tokens.  A long narrow table stands before you, rocking with the general
rocking of the city, making the balance sitting upon it fairly useless,
you should think.

On a Braided Kelp Walkway~
You stand upon a braided kelp walkway which trembles a bit to your step.
You can see the docks below through the holes in the mesh, making you a

You stand upon a braided kelp walkway which trembles a bit to your step.
You can see the docks below through the holes in the mesh, making you a
little dizzy.  A protected overhang to the south serves as a shelter and a
ladder twists downward through a small hole.

Under the Protective Overhang~
The enormous wall which protects the city also provides protection to the
homes carved into it. Seagrass pallets mark the sleeping area, and a small
brass kettle hangs from a spit near the edge of the overhang.  A few sacks
spill grain at your feet, and you get the sense that despite their meagre
existence, these people are getting by just fine.

A Sheltered Dock~
You stand upon a rickety dock made, evidently, from whatever wood could be
scavenged from the surrounding realms.  The floor of the home above your
head acts as a roof, giving some protection from the elements. You notice
a peddlar seated crosslegged next to a small pen. The docks lead off to the
east and west, and a braided kelp ladder twists through a small hole in the
ceiling above.

You are standing at the end of a flagstone road, whose terminus has created
a small clearing in the forest.  A few rough stones lie in a pile to the
side and hint of another large idea which fizzled when the rich coffers of
the road builder ran dry.  The paving stones are scuffed and rounded from
heavy use.  The road leads off to the south, and a faint path continues
into the woods to the north.
