Entrance to a Cave~
This cave entrance is very damp and cold and you can see your breath as you
enter. The cave continues to the north where it gets quite dark. It would be a
good idea to bring a light to see as you explore.

Dark Cave~
You are standing in a large, damp cave.  There are several stalagmites hanging
here with sharp points and some glowing fungus on the north wall.  There also
seems to be a small campsite here, as if someone may be living in this cave.
A pile of rubble blocks the exit to the east.

Hidden Cave~
You are in a small cave that branches off from the main cavern.  A pile of
rubble hides the exit here, but is easily passable.  It seems there was once a
cave-in here, blocking any further progress.  Some large mushrooms grow here
that are emitting a bad aroma.

Grassy Path~
You find yourself on a grassy pathway.  Tall grass surrounds the path, standing
about 2 feet tall.  The pathway is a bit overgrown itself.  From your inspection
you can tell that this path is not well kept or seldom trod upon.

Cavern~
You are in a deep underground cavern.  You can hear the pounding sounds of the
water hitting the rocks above you.  The cavern seems to come to an end here.
There is a glowing light coming from the east wall.
