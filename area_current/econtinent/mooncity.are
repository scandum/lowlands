{138}                                  Moon City
{308}
Moon City is a gambling and resort town. In recent years, the town has
suffered a decline in tourism due to rumors of a terrible creature
dwelling somewhere in the city. Nonetheless, a sizable number of people
still make the annual trek there to take part in some much needed
relaxation.

There is a rumor that somewhere in the city is the keeper of the oldest,
most sacred game in the Realms: the Deck of Many Things. If you're smart,
and willing, perhaps you will have the chance to draw from this infamous
deck.

The Sloped Trail~
The trail descends into a small, plush tropical forest. The trees lack the
typical bark and leaves. Instead, the long, thin braches are green with
fuzzy ivy and juicey fruit. Strange spiked flowers grow out from small
patches of green bushes and white mushrooms.

daring mortality.

The Training Hall~
This hall, established here by the Mayor for the health and well-being of
visitors to the city, is surprisingly well-kept and clean. Numerous
facilities lie about for use in honing your physical attributes: rope,
weights, a pool, track, altar, library, kitchen, and more. You feel ready
to work.

You walk along the northern avenue of the city where many of the gambling
houses and various other establishments are located. The many buildings
are stone or brick and quite spacious to accomodate the large crowds that
vacation here.

The Temple~
A temple is here for worship by the devoted citizens of the city, though
you sense it is rarely used by the mass public. Statues and incense
permeate the room. A domed ceiling depicts an interesting picture.

The Northern Fountain~
Alas, you find a small room in which to rest. The activities are so vast
in the city as to make one easily fatigued within a short span of time.
Roads run off in all directions.

A Dark Room~
You stand upon a black formless floor that stretches into a sightless void
of total darkness. The world is small and suspended, yet expansive and
never-ending. Your direct area is lighted by two large burning torches.
They illuminate a small oaken table and a mysterious figure of unknown
origin.

A Resident's House~
You stand in the home of one of the city's many citizens, most of whom
work in a trade affiliated with gambling. Food cooks in a pot on an iron
structure; wool blankets, wooden furniture and tiny items of little value
furnish the rest of the home.

The Dragon Show~
You enter a colorful room of noise and pomp. Posters on the wall tell the
legends of fierce dragons and extoll the virtues of Bahamut. A small
wooden stage is here, between two golden banners, raised about a foot off
the ground.

The Dragon Cage~
You arrive in a dismal cage that smells of droppings and discards. The
walls are a dull grey color though small bars in a window allow small
beams of light to sneak through. There is a small pile of hay in the
corner of the cage.

of palms and bamboo looms overhead, almost as if placed purposefully by
the native inhabitants.

The City Sewer~
You are surprised to discover such a sophisticated network of underground
tunnels. They are dark and wet, causing you to ponder the wisdom of
proceeding any further.

The wet tunnel leads on into the vast darkness. Strange sounds echo
throughout the chambers. Each cavern seems to be carved from solid rock,
though the ground consists of a soft, brown mud that sticks to your boots.

floor.

Your path ends abruptly here. The tunnel, now relatively dry, leads back
into the muddy caves and eventually to the city surface. Nonetheless, you
feel a strange sense of something peculier lurking in the shadows of this
room.
