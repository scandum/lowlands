{138}                               Mushroom Forest
{308}
In the far reaches of the eastern continent lies the mushroom forest.
The mushroom people are a generally happy people, but rumors have been
going around that not all is as blissful as it seems.  Sounds of war
below the forest grounds can be heard even in the highest tree tops.
The mushroom people are ruled by the Toadstool clan.  Long ago in the
mushroom wars, the Toadstool clan defeated the evil Fungus clan and 
vowed to protect the fair people who live in the mushroom forest.
It is feared the fungus clan may be trying to rebuild its empire and
overthrow the surface dwellers of mushroom forest.

A trail in the hills~
High rolling hills swarm about you like bees.  The small narrow paths are
lined with moss.  Tall grass sways to and fro in the wind, making an almost
eerie sound whisper in the hills.  The ground is moist and slightly muddy.
  The path leads north into the hills and south back to the valley.
  A lone mushroom grows on the ground here.

The sacrificial pit~
This place has the horrid stench of rotted mushrooms everywhere.  In the
middle of this dark dank chamber is a huge pit, possibly thirty feet wide.
Try not to slip and fall, it could hurt really really bad.  You were warned.
This must be how the Fungus clan deals with traitors and deserters.

Small torches line the walls in this bunker.  The walls appear to be of
finely cut stone slabs.  Further examination would show a wooden grain
set into the stone.  Stone cots are set on the floor, perfectly spaced

This room is, obviously enough, where people wait to have an exclusive
audience with the king or queen.  Odd however, is that there are absolutely
no chairs in this room.  Stone pillars mark a path that people should follow
when the lines get overly long, however.

The scent of incense fills this hut.  Mists swirl about in a very
magical way.  The room appears almost tropical with all of the very
magestic mushrooms growing everywhere.  Never before have you gazed
upon such a beautiful selection of mushrooms.  Their very presense
fills you with a sense of wisdom and power.
