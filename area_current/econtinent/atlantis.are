{128}                                  Atlantis
{308}
The story of Atlantis is a sketchy one.  The historians of the mushroom
village honor the Lord of Water who rules the seas and holds the lives of
those that take their existance from the water depths in the palm of His
mighty hand.  It is said that to the north of the mushroom forest once lived
an advanced race of clever people.  Their technology led them to great
achievement, so great that they managed to offend their god along the way,
and were duly punished.  This is where the stories fragment into embellishment, but if you spend time on the eastern continent,
you may indeed hear tales of intrepid explorers who have stumbled their way
into a city of bright turquoise, full of wonder and religious severity, and
never returned...

You have entered a large cavern carved by the ravages of a swiftly-flowing
underground river.  The water is black and deep, it's current making it
impossible to swim across.  You see a glint of something curious on the
wall on the opposite bank of the river.  The river flows out of a crack
in the wall to the west and follows the cavern to the east.

Before a Large Green Hedge.~
You have emerged into bright sunlight, or at least it appears to be sunlight.
You can't quite make out the sun, and the sky is a bit too blue.  You blink your
eyes and notice that you've run aground amidst tall grasses and amber waves of
grain.  The river that carried you here now plummets under ground once again,
into a hole far too small to accomodate you.  There is a large hedge to the
north, which appears to have been burrowed through.  Endless fields surround you
on all sides.  There is enough food here to feed a large city.

Row upon row of leather-padded chairs greets you as you wander onto
the senate floor.  Each chair belongs to a desk, and the desks are
each equipped with a pad of scrap paper, a tall jug of water, and a
leather blotter.  The hall is quite long, and the walls are adorned
with the likenesses of famous statesmen of the past.  The acoustics
are such that you can hear a whisper from across the room as if it was

Before the Prince's Podium~
You stand before the steps up to a huge ornate podium, from whence the
proceedings of the city are administered in an authoritative fashion.
While the city prides itself in its belief in due process and the
democratic ideal, it is the prince who has the ultimate say in affairs
of the state.  The stairs are ornate but well-used, while the podium
reflects the communal and universal worship of the sea which has its
grip on this city.  There are two alcoves, one to your left and one to
the right.

You find yourself in a dark tunnel.  The smell of body odor and old
meat is strong.  Whatever this tunnel was used for when the city
planners created it, it isn't used for that anymore.

The Healer's Room~
This room used to have a greater purpose, but now it serves as the
home of a curmudgeonly man with hair to his feet and a beard to match.
Bits of plants and the bones from a dozen small rodents litter the
floor.  The air is musty and smells of decay.

You've reached the top of the pillar, and now you see that it supports
part of the huge dome that is protecting the city in its resting place
at the bottom of a huge ocean.  As you reach out to touch the dome
itself, some perfectly reflective dust deposits itself on your
fingers, and in the place where you touched the dome, a small cod
puckers at you through the clear spot.  The entire city must be lit
from one light source which reflects evenly off the entire inner
surface of the dome.

An Overrun Home~
You've entered a building which has been entirely overrun by the
gravens ironically brought in for pest control.  There is garbage
everywhere, and the stench from these unsanitary creatures is
overpowering.  The walls are smeared and the furniture broken
and tossed about.  You wonder who was responsible for this grievous
oversight in public policy.

Grump's Winter Palace~
Somehow, a dwarf has made a home in this desolate city sector.  Among
all the trappings a dwarf needs to feel comfortable in his or her
home, a row of door knockers is laid out on a table, along with a
bottle of grecian formula 99: mandarin orange.

Before a Large Green Hedge.~
You have emerged into bright sunlight, or at least it appears to be sunlight.
You can't quite make out the sun, and the sky is a bit too blue.  You blink your
eyes and notice that you've run aground amidst tall grasses and amber waves of
grain.  The river that carried you here now plummets under ground once again,
into a hole far too small to accomodate you.  There is a large hedge to the
north, which appears to have been burrowed through.  Endless fields surround you
on all sides.  There is enough food here to feed a large city.
