the Grand Mistress~
The Grand Mistress of Magic is sitting here.~
She looks quite comfortable on her emerald throne. Amazingly young and
pretty for one of such stature in the guild, no doubt she has kept her
youthful appearance through the use of strong magics.
The Grand Master pets her familiar and smiles at you in confidence.

A dark hallway~
You are in a long dark hallway leading east and west. Not much can be
seen in the unnatural darkness here, but you get a deep sense of dread
the further you go.

The end of the hallway~
You are at the end of a long dark hallway. The darkness here is almost
tangible in its thickness. A deep sense of fear and loathing comes over
you.
  A pair of obsidian doors can be seen to the east.

The chamber of darkness~
You are in a vast chamber. The walls fade into darkness, leaving you
with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room. Swirling here and
there in the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in your
light and leave it that much darker here.

Torture chamber~
You are in an ill lit chamber. Instruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own. An operating table is here, though it is bare.
  An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.

The inner chamber~
You are in a small dark chamber. Upon the walls are glowing sigils of
dark power, scrawled and traced in an evil language no longer known to most
of this plane of existence. There is an obsidian altar here which seems to
glow, but does not shed any light, in fact it seems to be taking light in.

You are in a long well lit hallway leading east and west. The walls here
are a milky white color, and glow with a warm luminescence, as does the
floor. A feeling of goodness permeates the area, and you feel unworthy to

You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an unknown
metallic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.

You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.

glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
the fact that it ends in a blinding blue light to the west. On hooks set
into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy of a evacuation.

You seem to be floating in a magical energy field, though you cannot see

sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
  An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be an
exit.

on a desk.
