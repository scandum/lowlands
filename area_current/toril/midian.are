{171}==========================>THE QUEST OF MIDIAN<================================{088}

The quest here is not tricky nor difficult.  There is a nice storyline, and
lots of text to read.  Anyone using common sense can figure out what to do.
Due to the nature of the story, this quest can only be done once per reboot
or 10 real life hours. So if you can't seem to get anywhere, then maybe
someone just did the quest.  If so, just try again later.
~

0 MIDIAN_REQUIREMENTS~
{171}=============================>REQUIREMENTS<===================================={088}

The quests here do require some firepower.  An estimated group of ten good
chars should be able to complete it.  Also, a current class shaman is required
in order to successfully complete the quest.  You will see why once you finish
the first stage of the quest.  Paying attention to what the characters you
encounter say is also very important.
~

0 MIDIAN_EQUIPMENT~
{171}=============================>THE EQUPIMENT<==================================={088}

There are a few pieces of nice high level equipment here.  A few damage,
high ac, and mana items.

Most of you know me as Daith or Lobe. This is my first try at area creation
so please gimme a chance.  If you dont like my area, make a better one.
I encourage it.  I would like to thank Dave, my SUPER best friend in the whole
wide world for helping me do this.  Without him, I would have given up a long
time ago.

{308}
Long ago, the small town of Midian thrived with life and beauty.  One day
however, a dark portal opened within the center of the city, opening a
gateway to another realm.  Within a few days, the life and beauty of the city
began to wither away.  Using all the powers available to him, the Arch Wizard
Col'linz created a magical flame which would burn for all eternity.  The light
of the flame protected the city from evil, and peace was returned to the fair
city.  A massive temple was constructed on top of the gateway, effectively
closing the portal to the Dark Realm.  Unfortunately, the Flame was stolen
by the minions of the Dark Realm, and buried beneath a dark fortress, unable
to shine it's holy light.  The city once again fell into depair, and awaits
brave heroes to destroy the evil, and return the Flame to the City.

A caped warrior poses here.~
This powerful looking man is dressed all in white.  He tosses his head and 
his hair flips over to the otherside.  He sees you approach and flexes his
muscles in your direction, his big muscles you think to yourself.  This man 
seems very powerful and not someone to be messed with.

The tide seems to sweep you back in this direction.  Well, I have NEWS for
you, you are stuck inside of a swirling whirlpool!

Top of the mountain~
You stand at the peak of the mountain.  The ground looks very slippery here,
as if you could fall at any minute.  You can see a large body of water from
the edge of the cliff you are standing on.  The only way back is down.
You hope that you do not fall and drown in the deep water below.

On the moutain~
You are about halfway up the mountain now.  At this elevation, all you can
see are dead trees, and the snow covered peak.  A thick layer of clouds masks
all visibility at this level.  Footing is very slippery as well, due to the
hard icy ground.

Base of a high mountain~
You stand at the base of a tall mountain.  Looking up you cannot seek the peak,
for a thick cloud layer surrounds the center of the mountain.  You can make out
a small trail leading up, but it doesn't seem to have been used in a while.
