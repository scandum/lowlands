has but one occupant.  Several book laden shelves are propped against
the cave walls, and half finished wonders litter a dozen or so
long tables.  Small cooking fires dot the cave, and a muted symphony
of hissing, crackling sounds rise from pots of bubbling, often
luminous substances.

Sea of Swords~
You are sailing upon the Sea of Swords, a large body of
water off the Sword Coast.  The waves are fairly low, but
you would not care to be swimming.  Sea gulls drift above you,
and you can hear the occasional fish jumping out of the water.

On either side of you are luxurious looking buildings.  In the
distance you can see hovels, making a marked contrast to the
palaces they are near.  You can hear waves lap the against the
pier in the nearby harbour.
