Clarence~
Clarence~
Clarence is standing here working to get his wings.~
Yes, this is Clarence from "It's a Wonderful Life."  Since the movie is so
popular and overplayed during the Christmas holidays, Clarence has lost his
wings.  He stands here with a very mournful face, hoping that with each sale,
will earn him his wings so he can leave.  It's been almost two centuries that
he has been here, and he has gotten used to the work.
He doesn't seem to want to leave anymore.

As you begin to climb the towering mountains, you occasionally hear the joyful

of childhood snowball fights. As you look closer, you are able to make out a
path in the snow, leading north into a valley.

The magnificent vista below robs you of all thought and reason. With the hardest
part of the journey behind you, you take a moment to gaze out over your vantage
point.  At the feet of the mountains lie crystal clear lakes and pleasant

of the small house, and the red-cheeked smile of a toy soldier greets you as he
leans out the candycane window. {128}A sign stands here, begging for your attention.

Beginning of Scrooge Street~
This lane was named for the main character in Charles Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol". Other streets in the town are also named for well known Christmas
legends and stories. The town's residents didn't scrimp at all when it came to
the town's design. Streets are paved in red and white brick, reminding you of
peppermint candy canes. The buildings that lead off this road are also painted
in the same motif as the small guardhouse standing outside the gates.

wings are gently unfurled, and the water dripping from the wings is caught in
the reservoir that the townspeople gather for their drinking water.  Even though
the sculpture has been standing in the full heat of the sun, it seems not much
of it has melted, due to the powerful magic resting in this town.

Upon entering this small abode you are surrounded by the scent of wildflowers

where a hole in the vine ceiling allows light to come flooding in.  As you
continue to inspect the room your eyes are drawn away from the sunlit core to
one corner where you see a plethora of leather armchairs, couches and ottomans,
most of them in neutral colors, but one stands out.

A beautiful piece of workmanship, the ebony marvel looks both
dignified and comfortable, this is the place Baddie sits when she is
at her most pensive.  As night falls you can almost imagine BadHabit,
and her sister GoodMood sitting here with their friends discussing
adventures past, and adventures yet to come.  As you sit there
silently, thinking, voices start to sound, and images start to form as
if the room itself is remembering a cheery night.
~

As you look around you see BadHabit in her favorite chair, GoodMood
providing a small feast of appetizers, sitting in among the many chairs
you can see Gooddie's husband Jamon, and many of their friends.  As a
small storm starts to brew, a fire lights in the fireplace, without your
help.  As light floods into the corners of the room, the vision fades, and
you are suprised to see a door leading south. As you peer into the next
room, you see what appear to be BadHabit's private chambers.

The Retreat~
The first thing you notice upon entering this room is a large, plain looking
bed. As you take a seat on it to rest your weary bones it moves out from under
you, as if flowing away from your body. As you look out the small windows you
see a winter wonderland beyond them, and as the beauty of the softly falling
snow overwhelms you, you begin to understand why it seems to feel so peaceful
here.

then filled with water, and sealed.  This water bed is truly a
marvel, not having been seen before in the Realms.  Next to the odd
bed is a small table with a scroll, and plume where it is believed
that Baddie writes her deepest and most personal thoughts.

You are tempted to delve into her private scroll, and yet, the power

So strong are Baddie's feelings for what she has written that her will
for privacy thwarts even the boldest intruder.

Welcome to Maiden Oracle's house. It has many airy, peaceful rooms.  Surely one
will suit your mood. The furnishings are sparse but add to the element of
serenity within the house. Maiden Oracle is especially fond of kittens and

home and offers you the happiness and peace which she has lovingly placed into

which makes you feel so good.  Unfortunately, you can smell a funny odor coming

with a small section for honorary members.  On the east wall is a huge cage
with a fifty foot long anaconda and a sign that reads:
{118}     * DO NOT MESS WITH THE HOUSE PET *{088}
The south wall is bare except for a large peg rack with unknown uses.

Eurydice and Angelique's Home~
A room of warmth and comfort greets you.  There is a bright fire blazing in
the fireplace and the mantle is draped with pine and silver ferns.  Two
rocking chairs sit in front of the fire, and a small cat is curled up on
the hearth rug.  You could swear you hear the baa-baa of sheep somewhere
nearby, but you can't be sure.
