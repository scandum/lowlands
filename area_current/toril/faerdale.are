Thankfully the odour of the sewer is lessened in here.  Actually you can
smell someone cooking! A simple table is in the centre of the room, with
many stools pulled up to it.  A few mugs of ale are on the table and
plates containing all that remains of a hearty stew are pushed to the
centre out of the way.

Servants Hall~
This hall runs between the servants quarters and the oppulent luxury of
the High Wizards Tower.  Servants bustle busily back and forth carrying
cleaning rags and trays of food.  The room here is lit by the humble
candle, deemed not worthy of being lit by the magical orbs that the tower
is lit by.

Kitchen~
Pots and pans hang from the wall.  Fires burn brightly in various hearths.
Cauldrons hang over the fires.  A cast iron stove warms the room.  Upon the
stove sit pots simmer, emanating the most wonderful smells.  Bulbs of garlic
and onions hang from the ceiling.

On one wall is a large bed, covered in furs and silks and large cushions.
In the middle of the room is a large table covered in scrolls, books,
potions and spell components.  On one end of the table is what remains
of a meal.

City Street~
You are wandering along a street on the 'good' side of town.
Merchants scurry about getting ready to set up shop to sell
the residents of Faerdale their every need.  Things tend to cost more
in Faerdale as it is not on the normal trade routes.

City Street~
The citizens of Faerdale wander along the streets with false confidence.
They believe themselves to be undiscovered by the rest of the realms
and therefore crime to be low.  But the word is out and simple citizens
can no longer wander along without a care in the world.

City Street~
The streets of Faerdale are paved with cobblestones, so in the winter
you are not walking along in a muddy sloshy track.  Potted plants add
an exclusive atmosphere to the streets.  Fine houses line the streets,
windows open and curtains fluttering in the breeze.

Sewer~
You stand deeper within the sewer.  It certainly smells bad.
You can hear rats rustle nearby, and the splash of creatures
moving through the slimy and filthy water that covers the
bottom of the sewer, getting as deep as your calves in places.
