{300}
The Martherian Archipelago is the home of the fabled island nation of
Martherius. The main point of contact used to be from the port of Order's
Landing on the Southeast coast of Iosolo, however with the recent appearance
of a mighty whirlpool off the coast of the continent contact between the
mainland and the islands has ground to a halt. Tales told in taverns by
grizzled mariners say that the island chain consists of at least nine smaller
islands along with one large volcanic island. A few unreliable reports also
say that more than one mariner from the mighty city of Piscyra has been lost
at sea and found themselves near the southern tip of the archipelago.

{138}                                  Quests
{300}
There is one huge quest in this area, consisting of seven distinct stages, which
involves becoming a citizen of the island kingdom and working your way up
through the ranks. A second major quest is for Marauders and Ninjas only and
involves tracking down a missing person. A third major quest is for spellcasters
only and involves researching and utilising a new type of magic. The final major
quest results in a quick and easy way to move around the area.

There are also a lot of other interesting equipment in this area, along with
several miniquests. Some of the miniquests result in nice equipment, some are
just for fun, some are merely red herrings ;)

Note that due to the extremely powerful equipment to be found in this area most
of these quests have several points at which you can easily fail if you're not
careful and/or lucky.

Finally, be aware that a lot of the quest equipment in this area is for 1x - 3x
reincarnated characters only.

{300}
1. I have stuck to my usual preference of having examinable objects in room
descriptions.

2. This area is extremely large, but I have tried to avoid bloating the ocean
too much by implementing a different scale in the oceans compared to the land
masses. This results in a slightly unusual transition when you move from the
ocean onto land - hopefully it doesn't look too weird.

3. This area is designed for extremely powerful characters, but should still
have some leveling potential for resourceful high-level reincarnated characters.

divine intervention~
'The divine protection afforded to the fourteenth royal dynasty of Martherius is
something of a mystery. Shardik the Venerated tells us that it was during a
chance meeting between Lord Order and Perlethe the Founder that the arrangement
was made. Others have disputed this version of events, saying that it is purely
mortal magic based on the native peoples' variant of the 'tempus fugit' field of
enchantment.

In any event it was conclusively proved during the attempted assassination of
Dargaloth the Second that the 'Martherian divine protection', as it has come to
be known, does not have the same weaknesses as an ordinary 'tempus fugit'
enchantment, be it the native Martherian version or the Iosolo version.'

the commands I had become used to at home, here the captain has to give orders
such as 'Hard a'port', 'Hard a'starboard','Raise sails', and 'Lower sails'. It
took me some weeks to become accustomed to this formality aboard, but I
eventually found that it began to come naturally."

One points out over the starboard rail while the other points out over the port
rail. Under the stock of each weapon you see a small trigger which evidently
fires it.

passage~
"The woods available to the adventurous shipbuilder in the Martherian
Archipelago with a taste for experimentation include redwood, ironwood and
cherry. This author has conducted extensive tests with all three and categorised
his results. He determined that redwood, with the sheer height advantage, is a
very fine material for making ship's masts out of, while ironwood with its great
density is perfect for making strong and heavy keels. Cherry is the weakest of
the three commonly available woods but its springiness makes it a perfect
shock-absorbing wood suitable for the body of the vessel."

A shiny golden ringmail shield lies here.~
This shield is made of bright electrum rings stitched onto an oakwood shield.

Drifting in a thick fog~
You are drifting on the open seas in a thick fog.  Broad swells carry you far
into the air, and the horizon disappears for long stretches of time as you drop
into the troughs. The water is warm and briny, and it extends as far as you can
see in every direction. The fog seems less thick to the north.
