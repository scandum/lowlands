{300}
Kytar is located on the Northwest side of the Central Continent.  Within the
city you will find all sorts of fabulous things to do, and places to go.
The city contains all the usual shops, guilds, and homes, along with a
temple, a city hall, a jail, and a connection to Griffon Airlines.  There
is also a 14-part quest to complete.  I recommend visiting the General Store
and buying a map first.

Warning: Killers/Thieves and fighting are not tolerated on the temple steps.

This room is a mess.  From what you've been told, the deputy mayor left
a few months ago to establish relationships with the cities of the central
continent.  He hasn't been heard from since he left.  Rumors say he was
killed by bandits on the roads, but his body was never recovered.  The only
way out that you can see is to the south.

This is a most extravagent office.  The mayor's desk stands perfectly centered
in the room.  There is a great stain-glassed window in the north wall.  It
appears to be depicting a judge with a gavel, perhaps to symbolize the justice
that a mayor is responsible for upholding.  The exit is south, but to the east
you can see the mayor's personal library.

There isn't a whole lot to see at the moment though.  To the east you can see
guild street, and to the south you can follow serpent road to main street,
where you can find the shops, including a map of the city at the general store.

This room appeared darker from the outside.  Inside it is lit by strange,
glowing balls of light.  They're not hot to the touch, like fire would be.
There are a couple of bookshelves set into the northern wall, which probably
contain more knowledge of darker magic than you will ever possess.  The exit

Trail to Bill's Nerf Farm~
You're outside Bill's Nerf Farm.  Already you can smell the nerfs.  They have
an odor similar to fresh cut deer meat.  In fact, you catch yourself beginning
to drool a little.  A path in the wilderness is to the south, and the farm
is to the north.

Bill's Nerf Farm~
This is Bill's Nerf Farm, where anyone with a little money can purchase their
own nerf, and the prices are pretty good.  Bill lives in a little cottage here,
and the nerfs are located in a large pen to the north, where they graze at
their own leisure.  Bill seems like a nice guy, and you get the impression he
wouldn't try to rip you off.  The trail back to the city lies to the south.
