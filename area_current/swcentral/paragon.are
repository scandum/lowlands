for the truths.  Listening is often a key to learn just what people want, but
you cannot always be silent.  Also something to know, King Seflian deeply
respects his Champion and Queen Paragon hates homies with all her heart.

{308}
Throughout the ages, Seflian and his men from the bowels of the earth have
waged war on the Island of Paragon.  In Seflian's last assault he was very
powerful and managed to cripple Queen Paragon by cutting out her eyes.
Seflian also managed to grab Saddie's crystal ball and smash it.  Both
Saddie and Queen Paragon have been weakened severly by this and will be very
happy to have their items returned.

Dogot the right-eyed Magician~
Dogot is meditating here building on his already powerful magic.~
This magician seems to be very rational.  His hair is neatly combed, face
neatly shaved.  The only thing that would prevent this guy from being handsome
is his lack of a left-eye.  His right-eye seems to look out with a
distinguished and calm sense of reason.

paragon queen~
Queen Paragon~
Queen Paragon, creator and ruler of this island.~
A small somewhat simple looking figure is sitting upon the throne.  A torn
cloak and simple dress makes Paragon look more like a beggar then any sort
of ruler.  You can't even imagine how she has any power.  Two dark vacant
holes now replace the spot where eyes should be.  Perhaps you could give
Paragon a hand getting her eyes back.

perhaps you see something in the way she moves, but this body seems something
of a shell for something hideous underneath.  Her eyes are the biggest clue
a glowing red with only slits for pupils like that of a serpent's.

Long black walls stretch forth all around you creating a long narrow hallway.

the north with further blackness and salvation can be found to the south.

Dark walls which seem to suck out light, create a long narrow hallway. The
part of your mind that once had the ability to create magic seems drained.
The walls around you grow even darker as you progress, as if they were
absorbing your power.  The hallway stretches on to the north.  To the south
there appears to be some remenants of light left.

This is the bed chamber of the Anti-Wizard Felulius himself!  There are
the normal furnishings of a bedroom, a bed, chest-of-drawers, and closet.
There is also a pit here filled with the bones of dead mages, a key
ingredient to the making of dark matter.  The walls of this apartment are
no different than any of the other ones.  Dark, dull, magic sucking dark
matter.  There is a dark hallway to the south.

Decorating the dark black walls of this room are hundred's of magician's
heads.  The heads are of many different races, some of which disappeared
mysteriously thousands of years ago.  Some of the heads are freshly cut blood
still oozing from their necks.  There is a shiny white path underneath your
feet reflecting your light.  At a closer inspection you notice they are
skulls, no doubt from mage's of long ago.  To the west and south the dark
hallways continue.

Dark walls which seem to suck out light have come together to form a large

of the terrifying feeling of claustrophobia though you cannot figure out what
use this hole might have.  There are a few chairs strewn around made of the
same dark matter that the walls are composed of.  Discarded bagage is heaped on
the ground in enourmous piles leaving the impression that once people take
whatever journey that is offered in this room, they seldom come back. The
hallway stretches on to the west.

The smell of burning flesh fills your nose with such pungency it burns.
Crucified on either side of you are rows of small frail looking people with
the words, 'Stinking Mage' scratched into their foreheads.  Some of these
people are woman and even young children.  The rest of the terrain has been
completely devastated by the constant warfare and appears to be suffering from
extreme destrification.  Looking down at the narrow path on which you now stand
you can see exactly of what it is created, human fingers!  Thousands of fingers
rowed tightly together all facing north.  To the south there is a dark hole
made of dark matter slanting downwards forming into a sort of slide.

You are standing on a dark path that is hovering magically, feet above the

The Enchanted Wilderness~
You stand amids a living wilderness.  Vines are moving like snakes, trees are
walking around freely as if they were people, even the path you now stand on
seems to be traveling its own course.  In tiny little patches there is rain,
in others hail, while in others snow, sun, high humidity, desert like
conditions all within five feet of each other.  The wilderness has been given
a voice, and this is what it speaks.  It would appear as if this twisting path

The Poor Quarter~
You are standing between rows of buildings.  Dirt, papers, and other trash
blow through the blood stained streets.  Woman are working the corners and
press gangs are standing at the corners.  All the dejects have come here to
live out the rest of their miserable lives, magicians and warriors living in
complete disharmony.  Killing each other with complete abandonment because
even the guards are too afraid to visit here.  The filthy road leads to the
east while a beautiful, clean wilderness grows to the south.
