{300}
The City of Ruins is set in a city hit hard by a series of unfortunate acts
of the gods. Earthquakes have caused many of the buildings to collapse and
much of the city infrastructure is in ruins.

The population is slowly rebuilding their once proud city and business is
beginning to pick up. This area is the gateway to Raptor Island to the west
and Vulcano to the east and seems to recieve a steady stream of refugees
from all over the realms looking for another start in life.

Suitable for players ranging from 20 - 40, this area contains several small
quests and some unique equipment as described below.

{300}
One of the children has been lost and you are able to offer your services to
help the anxious mother and searching father. Speak with either of them for
more details.

The citizens and their children have collected many trinkets as they pick
over the remains of their once lavish houses. Whilst the trinkets have
little value in themselves, they can be turned into something much more
valuable if you take them to just the right person.

There is good opportunity to kill some of the local rats. Reports of bands
of adventurers collecting skulls as trophies have been circulating lately.

{120}                                  Equipment
{300}
There are some lower level items of armour that improve intelligence. They are
useful to wear as they improve your chances of mastering a skill. There are
several level 40 items of armour that can complete a missing set of damage
equipment as well.

A collection of various level 30 armor items and some level 40 weapons have
been included to provide a selection of weapons for the true fighters.

A wonderful kind of light has been found for sale in the city. One that
combines the essense of the earth inside a simple jar. Powerful magic
prevents the lava from escaping or causing too much heat.

There are also one or two curious containers that allow you to store your
items away from the prying eyes of thieves.

        - visit the searching father                  [mob: 12552]
        - find the lost little girl                   [mob: 12553]
        - return with her to the frustrated mother
        - give handwritten note to Fasto              [mob: 12501]
        - buy the items from the shop         [item: 12541, 12542]
        - completion bit (0 4 7) is set by Fasto      [mob: 12501]

Note that some of the mobs drop trinkets. If these trinkets are given to
Fasto [mob: 12501] then he will load some replacement equipment for sale.

The rats have a small chance of dropping a skull. If the player takes the
skull to Meldricko [mob: 12506] and triggers his greet program, then he will
offer to work on the skull. There is a 25% chance he is able to turn it into
one of the two enchanted rat skulls [item: 12561, 12562].

The ashen token [object: 12557] loads one of two portals randomly when
triggered using the trigger {010}jaunt{300}. These portals are single use and
lead to the rooms directly north, and directly south, of Neyland Square (safe
room). [room: 12515]

{300}
Some of you may recognise certain elements of City of Ruins. I would like
to thank Crouton for inspiring me with his classic area Pompeii. And of
course Scandum for creating the OLC (OnLine Creation) code - without which
this area would never have been created.

guesto ogre~
Guesto the ogre~
A sallow looking ogre hunches over his counter.~
Once an ogre with attitude to match his huge size, Guesto is no longer the
specimen he once was. Bad fortune has a lot to do with it, and a seemingly
endless stream of bad luck. He still manages a cunning glance at your bag
of gold and judges your custom accordingly.

The gate before you is well constructed from steel reinforced wood. It has
a large lock to one side, and effectively prevents any access to the city
once secured. To the south the road meanders away, troubled only by the
occasional refugee or gypsy who stops off to camp for a while.

To the north and south you can clearly see the devastation that has befallen
this city. Buildings are in ruins and the once proud owners are left with
nothing but rubble. To the west the gates of the city are visible, and to
the east you can see the city centre with it's over supply of visitors.

buildings half collapsed and people picking over the remains. The sewerage

Guard House~
The guard house has been patched up with tiles and the worst of the holes have
been filled with mainly recovered stonework. The final result is a dry room with
only a few drafts and a small stove in the corner to provide heat, light and the
steady supply of hot coffee that guards demand. You see the floor is worn stone
and is covered with scratches and grooves.

Guard House~
This guard house appears to have escaped the destruction that has touched so
much of the city. It has solid, plastered walls and the window still has it's
glass. A fire burns warmly in one of the corners. You see the floor is covered
by large mats and ill-fitting carpets. Whilst this remains an open building,
there is little wonder the guards spend more time indoors on duty at this gate.

The gate before you is well constructed from steel reinforced wood. It has
a large lock to one side, and effectively prevents any access to the city
once secured. To the west you can see the peaks of a volcano and a wisp
of smoke as it belches against the sky. Refugees pick their way in both
directions along the road in hope of a better future.

Road to Southgate~
The road here has been well maintained, and the drainage ditches appear
to have been cleared sometime recently. The steady stream of refugees from
the city wander the roads seeking a better life elsewhere. The countryside
spreads out all about you and to the north you see a city in the distance.
