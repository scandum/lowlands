Hirudinia is a small mining colony deep within the heart of the Order
territories.  Its people mine the land for magic, which they feed off of to
live and which they give to their Lord, the Lord of Earth, Order to power
his desire for Stability.  Recently, a powerful witch has taken over their
underground mining operation and is sapping the ground of all its magical
energy.

A room in the mine~
This room is not unlike any other.  The smell is overwhelming and sickening.
Muddy water is running from the cracks in the walls.  To the left, there is
a large composite of coal and iron jutting from the wall.  There are small
crawlways in every direction, leading through the maze of the mine.

A room in the mine~
This is another similar room in the mine.  Decay is in the warm, musty air.
Coal is burning and magic is flashing a certain shade of green.  The sound
of minors digging through the muck in search of more magic is echoing all
around.  There is a new corridor that begins to the north.

An opening to the corridor~
This room is unlike any other in the mine.  The torches have been replaced
by large, brightly shining lanterns. The smell has changed from sulfur to
rotting flesh.  Trails of dust and grime smear the walls and floor.  Magic
is pulsating through the air.

A sideshaft~
This tiny offshoot of the mining pathway is scattered with broken tools.
The floor and walls are very strong here, stronger than any other point in
the mine.  No doubt the miners have broken many a pick and ax here trying
to dig though this amazing hardened surface.

A slimy crack~
As you crawl through the mud and dirt into the small crack, your armor
scrapes and screeches on the hard rocks.  The mud covers your armor with a
dull black glaze.  You hear sounds sound like that of chanting of words of
wisdom echoing from beyond, but you see no visible exit.

What looks to be a tiny hovel before the entrance, turns out to be a

lore line the shelves on the walls, and fabulous artifacts are scattered on
the floor.  A man sits royally, absorbing magical prowess and knowledge.

knock even the greatest warrior off his feet.  The magical light from the

There is a strange green glow emitting from the cracks in the walls of this

everything in the vacinity, along with several deadly toxins that are oozing
from the broken ground underfoot.

The secret place~
This room is an empty as the human soul.  It is barren of all things.
There are no walls, as all space is undefined.  It is the perfect hideaway.
Everyone is here, but their faces do not show.  Time is everlasting and
continuous and space twists and warps in various directions and dimensions.

The dregs~
This small section of the city has been sucked dry of all of its magical
energy.  The buildings have lost their lustre and many are vacant.  There
are beggars, who had made their lives from magic living in crawlspaces
underneath this former section of the city.

Beggar's corner~
This is the home, a mere hovel, for many of the newly poor of the city.
Beggars rolling around on the ground, huddling together to stay warm,
desperately beg to taste your magical energy.  With only a touch from one
of these men, you can feel your magical energy drained.

Condemned house~
This once beautiful mansion has been recently deserted, as the owner
apparently had lost his magical abilities and can no longer keep the place
in good shape.  Rumor has it that he was an important person in his day,
and his family still makes residence in the city.

Pillars of Magic~
There are seven pillars here, reaching to the sky.  They are arranged in a
large semicircle surrounding the fountain.  Each pillar represents a
specific component of magical power.  There are specific relationships
between each pillar and the one next to it.  These relationships are for
the true magical beings to learn and to live by.

This is the largest, most expensive building, owned by the richest mining
tycoon in the realms.  Every wall is carved from marble, laced in platinum
and gold.  The floors are pure silver adorned with incredible life-sized
crystalline statues that seem to move almost as if they were alive.

Maynard's House of Magik~
This shop has the most insane mix of magic and ritualistic items anywhere
in the realms.  Dead beasts hang behind the counter on large meathooks,
while strange smelly green herbs and incense collect dust in the countertop.
Scrolls and potions promising true out of body experiences call out to
every customer by name.

This is the entrance to the Hirudinian mine of magic, where the faithful
citizens mine the ground in search of magical energies.  In the process,
they also mine precious metals with which they build their fabulous homes
and buildings.  The magic that gushes forth from the mine can enhance both
your mind and your life.

As you walk into the main room of the New Squid Empire you notice
immediately all of the squid artifacts.  There are many squids here that
predate the caretakers themselves.  How they got here no one really knows,
they have just always been here.  Jars and jars of squid preservatives line
the walls, protecting the squid of the realms from the harsh sunlight.
There are tables and chairs and tanks to accommodate anyone in the NSE.

The fine craftmanship of the guildhouse is second to none.  A magical
housing, standing to empower the less fortunate to train their skills, is
truly a unique occurrence.  The great magicians have found that, although
you are second rate to them, there is still a place in this world for you.  It
is of course a cruel trick by god to deprive you of magic.

The Pointed Finger Inn is a true testament to the power that magic holds

a hand, pointing a finger in shame to every non-magic user who enters the
city. It is merely a reminder to the citizens here that using the powers of
the mind to hone your magic skills shall redeem your soul.
