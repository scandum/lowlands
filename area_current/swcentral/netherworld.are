This area is the mystical Realm of the evil dead, the playground of demons
and the origin of the power of necromancery. It exists under the region
known as Avernus and encompasses the remaining 8 layers of Hell:
Dis, Minauros, Phlegethos, Stygia, Malbolge, Maladomini, Cania and Nessus.
Avernus is ruled by the pit devil Belial. The other 8 layers are ruled by
the dark eight: Furcas, Baalzephon, Zimimar, Zapan, Zaebos, Corin, Dagos,
and Pearza. These greater devils have equipment of great value to those
of evil orientation.

You must be strong to enter this realm of evil. Anyone with a weak frame
of mind would surely be killed by an overflow of negative energy.  Only
warlocks are capable of understanding the power of the Netherworld and
are therefore able to enter.

                         History of the Netherworld
{300}
Long ago, when the God known as Chaos kept balance, he saw an unfair bias
towards goodness in the universe. Seeing this, the powerful God created a
demi-God named Hades, the Prince of Darkness, out of all things evil,
unjust and impure. Hades was meant to restore the balance of good and evil
in creation and, in doing so, he created a lair for the damned which he
called Hell, a place to give evil an origin. 

This act pleased Chaos very much, but irritated Lord Order greatly. For
eternity, he had respected the work of Chaos, but with the creation of
Hades, he was greatly disturbed. Out of this displeasure he banished Hades
to an unknown place... but the dominion of Hades was left untouched, and
his minions were left free to continue their endless work of evil and
darkness in the Netherworld.

                         The Sword of Righteousness
{300}
A story related to the Netherworld is that of the Sword of Righteousness,
rumored to be the most powerful sword in the Realms.

In the time of peasantry, long before the current age, the dwarven race
ruled the underground. In those days, the dwarves were a kind race,
concerned for their young, intent on bringing peace and beauty to their
underworld tunnels. 

When the Orcish hordes began to appear in their tunnels, the dwarves were
rebuffed by their horror and savagery. Rape, pillage, destruction and
violence characterized this new race, and it forced the dwarves to take up
arms in defense. Skilled in the art of metal-making and smithing, the
dwarves made great weapons to battle against their enemies. But the Orcish
hordes were stronger and swifter. They lacked concern even for their own
kind, and this made them them unbeatable opponents.

Out of a need to regain the advantage, the dwarves met and pooled their
strength. Obsidian dwarves, outer dwarves, stone dwarves and elder giant
dwarves met, determined to find a solution. From the shared strength of
the eldest magic in the land, they created the Sword of Righteousness - a
sword of unbreakable stone and furious power. The sword caused all things
evil to scream in terror. Even speaking the name of the sword caused the
evil of the land to go mad with fear.

A single dwarf, a King amongst them, wielded the sword against the Orcish
hordes and drove them from their underworld. The struggle was at last
over. But the war had taken its toll on the dwarves, causing their culture
to grow violent and less harmonious. The different dwarven tribes, once
united, feuded against one another over possession of the mystical sword.

Sensing weakness caused by the division, a cabal of powerful demons
ventured into the dwarven lands and seized the sword. The sword was never
seen again, though the occultists who claim contact with the dead say that
the evil demons couldn't break its power. Instead, the demons took it
into the Netherworld, home of all things evil, where it supposedly sits
now, buried on the ninth level of the nine planes of Hell.

Before The Black Rock~
Before you stands an enormous black cavern, undulating with force of
truly immense proportions. You cannot grasp it's exact height as you
cannot see it's top, and it's width is guarded by infinity to your east
and west. The ground here consists of solid, unshakeable granite. An
ethereal wind is present here.
