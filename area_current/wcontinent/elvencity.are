A single great tree rises from the forest here.  An overwhelming
ancient presence presses on your mind.  You feel your identity 
slipping away, replaced by peace and certainty and permanence.  
You shake your head and blink rapidly trying to clear your senses.  
You feel that soon you will have no desire to leave.

Mercantile Branch~
A large tree branch has been flattened on the top to create a
comfortable area to walk on.  Your throat tightens a bit as you
notice how far it is possible to fall, and that there are no 
rails.  Elven merchants pass you by without much notice.

The Upper Realms~
You are in a sanctuary of peace and light, somewhere in the upper
realms.  Small clouds float in the distance.  Goodness and peace
permeate your being.  You feel as if you could stay here forever.

A Room in HELL~
You find yourself in a dark cave, an awful reddish light glimmers
from pools of lava below you.  Small devils chitter and giggle
along the edges of the room.

Nirvana~
You are in a nicely decorated room somewhere on the plane of law.
Strange beings move by outside the window.  They all seem to have
urgent business somewhere else in the realm.

Realm of Shadow~
You have been sucked into the realm of shadow by your shadow cloak.
Strange shadows appear and laugh and taunt you.  You feel quite 
nervous, perhaps you should attempt to recall.
