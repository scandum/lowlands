North Battlefield~
The northern part of the elven valley is controlled by the Lady's 
forces.  You occasionally see powerful magicks arc overhead.  As
they pass they charge the atmosphere, making your hair stand on 
end.  You notice small mounds of bone and ash which might once have
been alive.

There are far more than you expected.  You see many men, soldiers 
of the White Rose, who have been set as spirit guards perpetually 
standing between the world and the monster that would devour it.  
How driven they must have been.  How dedicated to their cause.

The shrine pays homage to the dual forces of creation, Order and

used to be, and hate the current rulers of the realms.
