{308}
The Castle and it's surrounding environs house a closely knit community
of hardy, honest folk. Their aging benefactor looks over them all and
makes sure that matters of state are dealt with promptly.

The King has a cough, the Prophet is lost and there are rumours that the
Gardener is involved in growing D'Shai. What's that all about?

{128}                                   Quests
{308}
There are four distinct quests in Stasis Castle. Visit the King, and
work with the Cook to help him with his cough before assisting them find
the Prophet. You will need to exercise your sword arm a little - and be
wary of the Scorpions... they sting!

If you can find the Scribe Master, he will give you some rather simple
tasks... but he's an accomodating old man... and should oblige with a
couple of nice containers and a writing impliment.

The Gardener is getting a little old and could always do with a hand in
the garden. The biggest problem is his failing memory... he is always
losing his tools and planting things in the wrong place. Rumour has it
he hasn't been able to control some of the hedges in the gardens!

The Quartermaster is a man well versed in herb-lore and able to outfit
the most adventurous campaigner.

{128}                                  Equipment
{308}
There is a selection of lower level levelling equipment that occasionally
falls from the corpses of various mobs, and the forest is a great place
to gather firewood.

The Kitchen is rumoured to have a Rat problem, and they have a Cat that
is trying his best to sort things out. Of course, the Cook isn't too
pleased at the Rats in her Kitchen! What's she gonna do?

The equipment you will find here ranges from level 10 through to 45,
and offers a nice collection of wear locations to compliment your busy
wardrobe.
