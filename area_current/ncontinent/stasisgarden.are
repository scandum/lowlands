{308}
Stasis Garden has been open to the public of Stasis Castle for what seems like
eternity... it is surprising you've not been there before. There are a lot of
beautiful creatures and plants living there in harmony. Many say that you can
meditate there better than anywhere else in the realm.

The Gardener tries his best to keep everything in order, but the rumours are
not necessarily unfounded. Along with the Master of Boats, he has done a
wonderful job in maintaining the special quality that makes the garden what
it is today. Why not come over for a wander along the paths and see if you can
solve the maze!

The Master of Boats has been looking after the boats by the lake for ever.
He doesn't get out much any more, but he always has plenty to say if you
stop by for a visit.

The Gardener looks after all the plants here, and whilst he's a little
older now and can't get about as much - he knows more than he lets on!

Many a wish has been fulfilled at the wishing well... always a popular place
amongst the young. Take a wander around the path then settle down and rest
a while at the well.

{308}
There is a selection of lower level equipment that are appropriate for
use in when you are in the garden. Some tasty fruits and nuts grow in
the garden, you just need to find out where.

The equipment you will find here is mostly level 30, and they will be
items you won't share. There is a very powerful staff that both guides
and refreshes.

If you were feeling hungry, the Garden is a great place to try. Don't
eat the toads though, they have hallucinagenic properties. Ducks are
a lot nicer when it comes to making sandwiches.

a batton~
A long length of oiled wood leans here.~
The wood of this batton has been painstakingly sanded and oiled by a skilled
craftsman. There is no chance of splinters nor warping due to water soaking
through. You recall that blood is easier to wipe off well oiled surfaces.
There are small grooves on the base of the batton that are well worn.

To the east you can see an expansive garden surrounded to the south by a well

Shrubs that have been carefully tended by hand line the paths of quartz stone
that meander through this wonder. The grass is cut evenly, and the smell of
pollen in the air is heavy. You feel safe walking on the path.

Your passage here has been blocked by an avalanche or rock fall of some kind.

In a small clearing~
This small clearing shows little sign of recent use. The trees appear to
crowd around you and you feel a little claustrophobic given the lack of
natural light. Small bushes define a clear boundary between nature and the
clearing you are standing in. The exit to the west is cleverly obscured by
the layering of bushes. The hard packed ground is firm underfoot.

On the marsh~
The thick vegetation here has matted together to form a kind of floating mass
that supports it's own weight and provides a place for reeds and small animals
to live. The reeds are quite tall here, the mud is thick and the frogs don't
appear to too much of a problem. The marshes continue to the east. The lake is
bobbing to the south.
