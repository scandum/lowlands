{120}
     The Tower of Training is the place where new adventurers would try
     to kill their first mob,  or get killed for the very first time by
     one.   The first tip that you will get from this help file is:  do
     not rush into leveling, but take your time to read the help files.
     Read all the room description carefully, and learn to use the help
     command. If you're still confused, ask people for help, but try to
     find things out for yourself before you ask someone else for help.

     Type HELP without an argument to enter the help menu. While in the
     help menu you can type  a  b  c  d  e  etc to choose from the menu
     options. Typing any non listed menu option will make you leave the
     help menu.

There is a Gargoyle here seeking revenge against his captors.~
You enter and are immediately confronted by an enormous creature whose skin
appears to be made of stone.  You can see that his talons are long, sharp and,
unquestionably, tipped in blood!  You may wish to consider whether you are truly
ready to fight this gargantuan.  If not, now would be a good time to FLEE ...
unless you wish to suffer the consequences!

the gold drakeling~
There is a gold drakeling whizzing around the room.~
This is a smaller drakeling, a fire-breathing lizard with scales of pure gold! 
Its wings are rose-colored and leathery, and although they look fragile, they
flap powerfully.  It looks more than a bit dangerous and you jump as you see a
slender flame snake out of its mouth.  As it flies around your head you can see
that there are some items draped about its neck that could be of some use to
you.

The pixie is a small, female warrior.  Though tiny in stature she appears
dangerous in attitude.  Short, shining blonde hair caps her tiny head, and her
eyes are a glittering emerald green.  Her iridescent wings flutter and gleam in
the dim light.  She holds a miniature dagger at her waist and narrows her eyes
at your approach.

the crater kobold~
A small, gnarled kobold stands here, glaring at your intrusion.~
The kobold is short, roughly the height of a human child, with greyish skin,
large, pointed ears and the face of an ugly dog.  It is wearing whatever armor
it has managed to scrounge from around the Tower.  Second-hand armor, yes, but
it would still be of good use to you.  Don't let it's small size deceive you ...
this is a dangerous opponent.  The kobold mutters at you as you enter, its
beady, black eyes fixed on your weapon.

BIG enough for him!  He is powerfully built and stands in the middle of the

pale, ivory skin.  You can sense the pure power radiating from this Avatar, and
you feel her desire to heal and protect you through her spells.  A deep love of
Fire dwells within her heart.

noble, a figure captured in the prime of life.  As you stare, it seems almost
lifelike.  Was that a flicker of light in one grey eye?

Some commands work with less than 3 letters, nearly all will work with 3.
The direction commands, since they are used often, can be typed with one
letter.  Therefore to move around, simply enter: {178}N{078}, {178}S{078}, {178}E{078}, {178}W{078}, {178}U{078}, or {178}D{078}.

Type {178}HELP TOWER OF TRAINING{078}, when you are done, type {178}DOWN{078}.

A Room in the Tower~
You are in a austere, brightly-lit room.  The walls are grey and there are
no windows. Small, magical globes of energy drift lazily around the ceiling
which provide you with light to see.  The entire place is out of this world.
As you become increasingly aware of your mortal body, you notice that the
clothing you are wearing is more appropriate for a spirit of the astral
plane than a flesh and blood humanoid.  A small plaque is on the wall here.

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command {178}CONSIDER{078} to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room west.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go {178}WEST{078} from
here, then {178}CONSIDER{078} him, then {178}KILL{078} him.  After a while, type {178}FLEE{078} to
escape from him.
{078}
You can also set your character to flee automatically with the {178}WIMPY{078}
command. Type {178}HELP WIMPY{078} to find out more about wimpy.
{078}
After you flee, you will be back in this room.  Don't worry, the wall of
force will keep the creature from following you. When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go {178}DOWN{078}.

{078}The avatars of the Training Tower have summoned some monsters for you to kill.
In the four force cages are four monsters of various types.  Kill them all.

To attack the first monster in the room use {178}K{078} this is short for {178}KILL{078}.
If you want to attack a more specific target use {178}KILL TARGET{078} where target is
at least the first 2 letters of the monster's name.

After you kill a monster you will automatically {178}SACRIFICE{078} the corpse, equipment
held by the monster will fall from the corpse into the room. You can pick up
the equipment using {178}GET ALL{078}.  You can then use the command {178}WEAR ALL{078} to wear
your newly won equipment.  If you already have the equipment lying in the room
use {178}SACRIFICE ALL{078} to get rid of it.

If you get wounded in combat you may need to {178}SLEEP{078} to regenerate hit points.
After you are back at full health you can use {178}WAKE{078} or {178}STAND{078} to get back up.

Here is your chance to go into each office and talk with their Recruiters. They
will tell you why you should become a follower of their god.  Don't worry, there
is no need to make any hasty decisions. You cannot actually make a commitment
here.

If one of the Recruiters says something in all capital letter, try saying that
word back to them. This will prompt the recruiter to tell you about that
statement. These 'keywords' as they are called will not always be capitalized,
but it has been done so in this area so that you can practice the concept. 
Beside one word, you may be required to answer with one whole sentence.

When you are finished talking with the Recruiters, continue practicing with your
mortal body by using the Intermediate Combat Hall downstairs.

Chaos's Recruiting Office~
You are in a recruiting office for Chaos.  The walls of the room are covered in
soft, burgundy leather.  Golden sconces lit with ivory candles brighten the
surroundings, and a fire pops and crackles in the hearth on the south wall.

You have entered a recruiting office of Order.  The ceiling is made of glass,
allowing the glow of sunlight and coolness of moonlight to stream in.  Dark
wooden shelves display rare and beautiful plants and flowers and a small rowan
tree grows in the east corner.

The Chamber of Testing~
This room, or chamber, is softly lit, and its centerpiece is a low, marble
pedestal.  A gentle twinge beneath your ribs affirms that your first true test
is at hand.  You are suddenly captured by the grey stone gaze of the statue
before you.

If you can kill the stone statue then you have passed the Tower's Test
of Completion.  As a reward you can pick up your token of completion from
the golem's corpse.  Make sure that you can at least handle the intermediate
hall of combat before you try to kill the statue.  The entrance hallway of
the tower is beneath you.  Beyond it lies the city of Chakkor.

Storeroom~
This room is a treasure trove of advanced magical knowledge.  Summoning wands of
all shapes and sizes line the wall, each labeled with the name of a different
monster.  Unfortunately, all of these things are sealed away beyond your reach,
behind powerful magical force walls. Almost escaping your notice is a small
force door to the south.

To find out your attributes, type {178}SCORE{078}.  You can improve your attributes
in the Training Room below. Later on, you will be able to practice your
skills and spells in by finding your guild in the city of Chakkor. You
can continue through mud school by going down.

Another way to look at your attributes is by typing {178}STATUS{078}. It is slightly
shorter and shows only the most essential information.

You are in the Training Room of the Tower. The room is watched over by an
Avatar who seems to create training tools out of thin air. The whole room is
filled with an aura of hard work. When you are finished here, you should
continue downward. As you descend through the tower, you will learn all of
the basics of being a mortal.

Welcome to the Training Room.  Here you can train your attributes.  To train
an attribute, you need enough practices.  To find out how many practice
sessions you have, type {178}TRAIN{078} while you are in this room.  To train for a
specific attribute, type {178}TRAIN <ATTR>{078} where attr is the first 3 letters of
the attribute you want increased.  Type {178}HELP TRAIN{078} for more information.
Generally, your prime attribute costs three practice sessions to increase.
Any other attribute costs five sessions. Type {178}HELP STATS{078} to find out about
your prime attribute.

Welcome to the Practice Room.  Here you can learn your skills and spells.
You are forbidden to learn skills until you reach at least third level. If
you aren't third level, go back to the top of the tower to train more of your
attributes instead. To see a partial list of skills and spells you can
practice and how many practice sessions you have, type {178}PRACTICE{078}.  To
practice the specific skill, type {178}PRACTICE <SKILL>{078}, where SKILL is the skill
or spell you wish to practice. Practicing increases the amount you know of
that skill or spell, up to a certain maximum.

It is important to note that this practice room is only for use before you
leave the tower. Once fully into the mortal world you should seek out your
guildhouse to practice in.

Entrance Hall of the Tower~
You are standing in the Entrance Hall of the Tower of Training, although Exit
Hall might be more appropriate, since new mortals materialize at the very
Pinnacle of the Tower.  The hall is pearl grey and a golden stairway leads both
upward and downward.  The City of Chakkor can be seen through a huge,
vaulted doorway to the north.
