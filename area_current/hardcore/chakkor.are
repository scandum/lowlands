Experience will expose you to a number of potentially useful commands on
Mortal Realms. But to offset the need for such experience, a listing and
explanation of many of these commands are within the pages of this book.

The "Area" command. This command can be used to see how many players are
currently visiting an area, or how many rooms are there, or how many
mobiles (monsters) exist there. It is a useful way to get info on an area
without wading through the voluminous area list.

EXAMPLE OF USING THE "AREA" COMMAND:
area savant village

This would show you a quick view of the statistics on the area known as
Savant Village.

For more information type: HELP AREA.

The "Buffer" command. This command lets you scroll back and see what took
place on your screen in the not-too-distant past. It is extremely useful
to see who told you what while you were AFK, or to go back and see what it
was that a particular quest mob told you.

EXAMPLE OF USING THE "BUFFER" COMMAND:
buffer 1

This would show you everything that scrolled across your screen one (1)
page ago.

For more information type: HELP BUFFER.

The "Grep" command. This keyword can be just as useful as the Buffer
command, and it is commonly used for the same reasons. Grep allows me to
search my not-too-distant past for a specific word.

EXAMPLE OF USING THE "GREP" COMMAND:
grep talk

This would show you all lines that appeared on my screen that contained
the word "talk" in the not-too-distant past.
 
For more information type: HELP GREP.

{070}Tactical Display

The tactical display is what gives you a heads up view of what is
taking place on the mud around you.  It is configurable to any size for
the preferance of the user.  Typing "tactical 4" will bring up the smallest
map size available.  Larger or smaller numbers will change the size
accordingly.  

Once you have brought up a tactical display it will show you several
things.  One of which is a map in the top right side of the screen.  This
map includes a short name of the rooms leading from the one you are in, with
the room you are in centered in the right side of the display.

The left side of the display will list the names of the characters and
mobiles(monsters) in the room with you.  Next to each name there will be
three letters or numbers.  The first is the health of that character ranging
from {120}F{300} {070}to{300} {110}0{070}, F being Full hit points, and 0 being 0% of hit points remaining.

The next two letters or numbers are the tactical index which is explained
in topic "2".  More information can be found by typing "help tactical"{300}
~
E
2 index~
{070}Tactical Index

{070}The tactical index is the two numbers, letters or symbols between a mobile
or characters health and its name.  These letters and numbers do more than
create cool words and patterns.  They are used to denote who a mob or
character is fighting.  When a mob is fighting it will include a ">" after
its name which points to the index of what it is fighting.  Because of this
it is important to set your index to something unique and recognizable.  For
instance I would set my index to Ja by typing "tactical index Ja".  I would
thereafter see myself on the tactical display as:{300}

  {120}F{300}Ja{150}Jaxom{300}{070}

If I were fighting a mob named Bad Guy it would show the following on my
tactical display:

  {120}F{300}Ja{150}Jaxom{300}>Bg{070}
  {010}2{300}Bg{170}Bad Guy{300}>Ja{070}

In this way you can determine who is fighting what in a room.

3 color~
{110}C{120}o{130}l{140}o{150}r{070}

The color command includes more than just a simple on and off although that
is where it all starts.  Typing "color on" will turn on your color display
just as "color off" will turn it off.  Remember you must be in VT102 mode
in order to use color.

Typing "color" on its own will give you a list of all the colors used in
your tactical display.  With the defaults it will create quite a rainbow on
your screen.  Any of the colors on your tactical display can be changed at
any time using the color command.  The format for the command is:

color <text type to change> <foreground color> <background color>

For instance typing "color 1 0 7" will change a part of your tactical display
to a{300} {107}white text with a black background.{300}
{070}More information can be found by typing "help color"{300}
~
E
4 vt102~
{070}VT102

This is the interface that makes the whole tactical display and color
possible.  Typing "vt102 on" turns it on just as "vt102 off" turns it off.
While in VT102 mode you may need to configure the number of lines used by
your screen.  A standard size would be 24 lines so you would type "vt24"
to set your tactical to that.  The number of lines will of course be
dependant on your telnet client and monitor etc.

More information can be found by typing "help vt102"{300}

spam~
{070}SPAM

Spam is text that fills the screen making things scroll off of it.
A minimum amount of spam is legal, but when a person fills others screens
with too much text, it is called Spamming someone.  This is considered
illegal when it involves 4 or more lines of text.  So try not to be too
much of an annoyance.

For a greater list of MR policies type "help mrpd".{300}

fight~
{070}Fight Spam

Spam is text that fills the screen making things scroll off of it.  Fights
tend to cause a lot of this unless you know how to set things otherwise.
In order to look at the spam settings you would type "spam".  From there
you may choose which if any spam settings you wish to change.  To do so
you would type "spam <letter>" where letter denotes the letter associated
with a specific spam.  For instance, if you typed "spam b", you would no
longer be told when you miss an attack.  "spam k" is an important one to set
when you are grouped with others, as this will give you a report each round
on the hit points of others in your group.  Those with at least average
internet links can handle "spam a", "spam c", and "spam k" on even in the
largest fights.{300}

split~
{070}Split

The split config is one of the first settings you should change when you
create a new character.  By typing "config +split" you will have your
character automatically pick up all gold dropped by a corpse and split it
between all members of the group.  This saves a lot of time over manually
picking up gold all the time.{300} 
~
E
exp~
{070}Exp

Exp is a config that saves you from using the level command to figure out
how much your character has to level.  By typing "configb +exp" your
display at the bottom of the screen will now show experience need to level
rather than total experience gained.{300}
~
E
brief~
{070}Brief

Brief is a config that most players eventually use.  The brief toggle
determines whether or not you see room descriptions.  So that an experienced
player may type "config +brief" when walking through rooms they are familiar
with.  This save much time and spam and is great for those who are charged
for the internet by the byte.{300}
~
E
castles~
{070}Castles

The castles config is one that can save on a lot of confusion when exploring
a new area.  If you type "configb -castles" you will no longer see the
entrances to player's castles.  This can be very handy when you are lost in
a place you have never been or when you are trying to go somewhere given
directions.{300}
~
E
peek~
{070}Peek

This is a config used only by rogues.  When a rogue with the peek skill
looks at a player he will find a huge list of equipment that shoots off his
screen making things difficult to see when you are trying to figure out
what equipment a player is wearing.  By typing "configb -peek" you will
not see the equipment a player has in inventory any more.{300}
~
E
autoloot~
{070}Autoloot

This config is often used by new players but later turned off as a
character gains in level.  If you type "config +autoloot" you will
automatically pick up all equipment that drops from a corpse you have just
killed.  This saves on time and is excellent for the lower levels when you
need all the gold and equipment you can find.  At the higher levels, however,
it tends to just clutter your inventory.{300}
~
E
quiet~
{070}Quiet

The quiet config is a command that comes in useful when killing mobs that
drop lots of equipment.  By typing "config +quiet" you will no longer see
any equipment that drops out of a corpse.  This is nice when ten things drop
out of a mob each kill but remember to turn it back off when you go to kill
a mob for its equipment.  Otherwise you may find it a bit confusing as to
why you didn't see a mob drop its equipment.{300}
~
E
chat~
{070}Chat

This config is one of the most used configs in both directions.  The racial
chat channel is turned on and off in this way.  The default setting is on,
so type "config -chat" to turn it off.  Most new players tend to keep the
chat open as it is a good way to gather information.  More experienced
players either turn the chat off if they are busy leveling and not wanting
to be spammed by chat, or they turn it on if they feel like talking.{300}

Entrance to the Hall of Necromancy~
You are standing in a great foyer at least 50 feet across with an amazingly
large spiral staircase rising above the room at least 4 stories, before
before vanishing into the maticulously painted ceiling.  Statues of all the
dead sons and daughters of Chaos surround the chamber in recessed alcoves.  The
stairs down lead into the city proper.
  There is a large checkered area on the floor, with small figures moving about.
  There are plaques to Dregoneous, Rendorous, and Bendabanus.

Which plaque?
~
E
dregoneous~
The plaque under this masculine statue tells the story of the Eldest of the
Mortals.  He is the father of all Drows, and had the strength of 4 gods.
When he walked, even Belial tembled.
~
E
rendorous~
The plaque under this rather cannine statue tells the story of the court
jester that entertained Chaos himself with the most diabolically chaotic feats.
~
E
Bendabanus~
The plaque under this stalwart figure tells the story of the first of the Humans
and how he brought about the best of all those in the followers of Chaos.  Yet
they were to be the first of the converts into Order, therefore being the thorn
in the side of Chaos.
~
E
checkered chess figures~
The chess set figures move about on their own accord.  The Tower of Necromancy
has survived the destruction of the Chaos/Order war because this is where they
are constantly involved in their games of chess.  Some even contemplate that
the destruction of the Chess Board would destroy the entire Realm.

Library in the Tower of Necromancy~
There are several rows of tables, with large chairs and candlabras.  The
walls are covered by scrolls, tomes, books, and parchments of vague spells
that only necromancers seem to be able to understand.

scrolls~
One of the scrolls explains:
"... The shouts can be heard faintly even when not using
the sacred magicks. They emanate from the souls of the dead,
screaming for relief from the eternal torment and suffering 
they must endure. To hear their words you will need the better
senses of the detect magic spell. Then, to prompt their shouting,
scream loudly. Their wails will then be heard."
~
E
tomes~
One of the tomes reads:
"The song of the dead may be sung to gain entrance to 
the home and origin of necromancery. The song's words 
are written in the tongue of our trade, the subject
of this tome. The letter A in the common tongue
corresponds to the necromancer's Z. The letter B 
corresponds to the necro's letter A. The letter C
corresponds to the necro's let..."
The rest of the document is illegible.
