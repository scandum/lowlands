0 HUMANS HUMANINTRO~
{128}
                                   Humans
{300}
Humans are the most adaptable race in the Realm. As such they make up the
majority of the population.  Although possessing no special abilities or
bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible race.  Their height,
weight, eye and hair color vary greatly.  They tend to live in large cities
and are exceptionally tolerant of races different than themselves.
~

0 VAMPIRES VAMPIREINTRO~
{128}
                                  Vampires
{300}
Vampires are reincarnations of humans, cursed to live for eternity.  Though
undead, these creatures, also known as the hunters of the night feed off of
the vitae of living beings.  They are gifted with the ability of magical flight
and to see even in the darkest hours.  Along with the weaknesses of undeads,
they are more vulnerable during the day.
~

0 WEREWOLVES WEREWOLFINTRO~
{128}
                                 Werewolves
{300}
Werewolves, just like vampires, are known as the hunters of the night.  A nose
to the wind and a wild throng of rage in their blood.  These creatures follow
the darkest paths of the beast, being able to turn their body into a furious
macabre of destruction, by embracing the wolf within.  Stronger and hardier
than normal mortals these supernatural beasts can change at will to serve
whatever purpose is needed.
~

0 GNOMES GNOMEINTRO~
{128}
                                   Gnomes
{300}
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of races, they
are well versed in their studies of knowledge and magics.  Due to their
familiarity with such lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can
however, suffer tremendously from physical attacks.  They most often prefer an
evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of pipeweed bread, and a cup of ale
over venturing out into the realms.
~

0 ELVES ELFINTRO~
{128}
                                    Elves
{300}
Elves are tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature.
With a lighter frame than humans, they make up their lack in strength and
stamina with their superior agility, both in thought and movement.  Elves
prefer to stay close to nature and far away from dark magic.
~

0 ORCS ORCINTRO~
{128}
                                    Orcs
{300}
Orcs are large and dull of wit, with short but broad bodies.  Their poor
mental abilities is offset by an iron constitution, coupled with abnormal
strength.  They fear magic, and brute combat is the natural call which stirs
in the soul of an Orc.  They stand approximately five to seven feet tall and
see perfectly during the night.
~

0 OGRES OGREINTRO~
{128}
                                    Ogres
{300}
Ogres stand from seven to nine feet tall in height and are known for their
muscle-packed bodies that can weigh from three to four hundred pounds.
Most are relatively hairless, their bodies covered with small, boney growths.
Ogres inherit great physical attributes and healing powers from their distant
ancestry, wherein lies the hints of giant blood.
~

0 DROWS DROWINTRO~
{128}
                                    Drows
{300}
Drows, also known as dark elves are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.
They were once part of the community of Elves which roams the forest today,
but have long since moved under ground, building vast subterranean cities
and complex networks of caves.  They are lightning fast, and see with ease
in the darkest pits of the earth.  Their nature often forces them to choose
between either dark magics or dark alleys.
~

0 DRAGONS DRAGONINTRO~
{128}
                                   Dragons
{300}
Majestic, and respected as the wisest of all noble creatures, the name strikes
fear and awe into the hearts of all in its presence.  Dragons have grown
scarce over the ages.  They are armored both above and below, with strength
beyond that of mortal comprehension.  Dragons posess the ability to fly amongst
the clouds, which is the pride and purpose of all dragon life.
~

0 DWARVES DWARFINTRO~
{128}
                                   Dwarves
{300}
Dwarves are a race of mountain and underground dwellers.  Naturally resistant
to magic, and having the strength and constitution of ages, these stalwart men
are fearsome Rangers.  Dwarves can see in the dark and move at a fairly
slow rate of speed.  A dwarf can be described as rough, dark eyed and tanned,
the smell of forge and deep earth exude from their bodies.
~

0 HOBBITS HOBBITINTRO~
{128}
                                   Hobbits
{300}
Hobbits are small humanoid creatures. They are a peaceful race that are not
known to be very adventurous. They are able to move very quietly when walking
barefoot.
~

0 DEMONS DEMONINTRO~
{128}
                                   Demons
{300}
Demons are cruel sadistic humans now turned to the darkness within.  They
have an uncany power to curse their foe.  Far stronger and more stalwart than
some races, the demons are fierce shadow Rangers.  Because of their
transformation, they have lost some of the mental capabilities that graced
their previous forms, and yet the natural talent for magic embues them.
~

0 WRAITHS WRAITHINTRO~
{128}
                                   Wraiths
{300}
Tethered to this realm by some fetter, a wraith is a head mortal who has
unfinished business in the realms.  Since these beings are so incorporeal
they lose much dexterity and strength, but gain wisdom and intellect beyond
imagination.  Slow of movement, but strong of magical incarnation, these
spirits are supreme amongst the magic wielders.
~

0 TROLLS TROLLINTRO~
{128}
                                   Trolls
{300}
Trolls are perhaps the strongest, yet obviously least intelligent race.
Sentient, yet posessed, the Troll's wounds begin to close as soon as it
is cleaved.  Standing seven or more feet tall, with weight above 300 pounds,
every Troll is a powerhouse of carnage.  Motley green flesh covering grizzled
features, allowing only a scowl.
~

0 TITANS TITANINTRO~
{128}
                                   Titans
{300}
Titans stood up to the gods and are now merely a shadow of former power.
Towering the humans, titans are incredibly strong, wise, and hardy.  They
walk at slower speeds to insure they don't crush anyone.  Excellent at
combat and natural magics, titans become strong in both fields the more
they traverse the realms.
~

0 RANGER RANGERS RANGERINTRO~
{128}
                                  Rangers
{300}
A Ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the Ranger is adaptable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a Ranger is physically skilled enough to take on most any
foe. A Ranger typically travels light, but he does have the mighty strength
of a Ranger to carry equipment needed in his travels.             

A Ranger is the easiest class to learn for a person new to MUDs.
~

0 MONK MONKS MONKINTRO~
{128}
                                     Monks
{300}
A Monk is a mighty healer and protector of the weak.  Led with a mission to
heal and teach, Monks have many varied and sundry healing spells at their
command. Having spent many years in strict discipline and rigourous training,
Monks are adept at unarmed combat and rarely bear weapons, preferring to rely
on their hands and feets. As a Monk gains levels and experience, so also do
they gain further wisdom and knowledge in the arts of healing as well as in
the arts of unarmed combat.

The wisdom of the Monk in the ways of magic and the art of healing, makes
them a wonderful companion to those who gain their trust.

Monks are fairly easy to learn for players new to MUDs.
~

0 MARAUDER MARAUDERS MARAUDERINTRO~
{128}
                                  Marauders
{300}
The marauder is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  They are known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys.  The skills of the marauder reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs.  It all sprung forth from the dirty city streets.

Marauders start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and
second attack they soon become dangerous foes.  A Marauder is always useful
when there is  a lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes to acquire
without detection.

Rogues are easy to learn for players new to MUDs.
~

0 ELEMENTALIST ELEMENTALISTS ELEMENTALISTINTRO~
{128}
                                Elementalists
{300}
The Elementalist is one of the three greater schools of magic. From an early
age they are taught how to reach past the boundaries of the prime physical
plane and reach into the neighbouring elemental planes. This gives the  
Elementalist great power over their physical environment. They can summon
forth stone to cover their bodies with impenetrable armour, conjure forth  
springs of refreshing water or fiercesome fire elementals to do their bidding.

Elementalists have so much control over their physical environment, they are
not restricted to casting spells in their current room, they can range cast
them into the surrounding area!

Elementalists are hard to learn by new players to MUDs.
~

0 ILLUSIONIST ILLUSIONISTS ILLUSIONISTINTRO~
{128}
                                Illusionists
{300}
The greater school of Illusion is greatly respected throughout the land, for
within, it's members learn the most destructive spells magic can offer. They
fight along side Rangers, combining magick and steel in a synergy of raw
energy. 

Illusionists are capable of confusing and demoralising their enemies with a
range of spells of deception, causing hallucinations, blindness and even
madness.

Illusionists are slightly hard to learn by new players to MUDs.
~

0 NECROMANCER NECROMANCERS NECROMANCERINTRO~
{128}
                                Necromancers
{300}
Necromancers are the most scholarly of the greater schools of magic, and have
spent millenia furthering the knowledge of their guild. As a result, they have 
at their control, some of the most powerful spells in the world. Necromancers  
can bend the fabric of the universe to suit their desires, allowing them to    
transfer objects and people across vast distances, magically. They can even    
open semi-permenant rifts in space and time visible only to the trained eye.
   
Necromancers also study the nature of death, and are capable of giving some  
form of twisted life force back into the bodies of the slain, as well as
tap the life force of other living creatures.

Necromancers are very hard to learn for players new to MUDs.
~

0 NINJA NINJAS NINJAINTRO~
{128}
                                   Ninjas
{300}
Ninjas are the members of the darkest profession, and are generally shunned
by the more reputable members of society.  They learn the art of killing
while unseen, and have developed many skills to allow them to sneak around
unseen, and unheard.

The Ninja is a difficult class to learn for players new to MUDs.
~

0 GLADIATOR GLADIATORS GLADIATORINTRO~
{128}
                                 Gladiators
{300}
That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and this certainly goes for the
slaves who surive the combat arenas. Gladiators are deadly, but somewhat
limited fighters. The spear is often their weapon of choice.

The Gladiator is a difficult class to learn for players new to MUDs.

0 LANGUAGE LANGUAGES~
{138}
                                  Languages
{300}
Characters initially receieve the language of the character's race and two
other random languages.  After a character reaches 3rd level a new language
is added.  This continues every 3 levels until all languages are known.

When a character tries to speak to another character, it will only work if the
speaker's current language (set by SPEAK) is one that is known by the listener.
If the listener does not understand, the speaker and the listener are notified
that they are not speaking the same language.  The LANGUAGE command lists all
the languages known by each character so that the correct language may be
found.

Monsters, and other beings in the game will only notify you that they are
speaking the wrong language if they try to talk to you or you use a TELL
to talk to them.

There are several commands, spells, and skills to get around the problem of
language barriers, but these are not initially given to the player.

{300}
Your character's race modifies several things in the game:

{168}1)  {300}Your race's language is always selected when the character is created.
{168}2)  {300}Your race will initially modify what your stats are.
{168}3)  {300}Some combinations of race and class are not allowed.
{168}4)  {300}Your race will determine your maximum attributes.
{168}5)  {300}Your race will determine your vision characteristics.
{168}6)  {300}Movement usage is modified by your race.
{168}7)  {300}Races have varying maximum rates of speed.
{168}8)  {300}Certain races are only available at higher reincarnations.

0 INTERP INTERPRETER~
{138}
                                 Interpreter
{300}
The interpretor of Lowlands includes many advanced features:

{168}1){300}  The ALIAS command can make redefined commands of multiple lines
{168}  {300}  and including arguments inside the alias.
{168}2){300}  The use of the '!' or '.' command repeats the previous command.
{168}3){300}  '.' followed by a letter repeats the last command started with that letter
{168}4){300}  The use of the '&' character will create one line of code that is
{168}  {300}  executed simultaneously.
{168}5){300}  All commands, and names of people, creatures, and objects may be referenced
{168}  {300}  by the first two letters that match with their actual name.
{168}6){300}  Scroll back buffer allows looking at previous screens.  see HELP BUFFER
{168}7){300}  On any given entry, you may enter up to 8 lines of text.
{168}8){300}  Commands that start with a number are repeats.

  example:
      t bal I have a question for you. & say How are you?
  executes as:
{138}      You tell Baldy 'I have a question for you.'
{038}      You say 'How are you?'{300}
  if you follow with:
      .
  executes as:
{038}      You say 'How are you?'
~

0 BUFFER~
{168}
Syntax: buffer [<pages>]
{300}
The buffer command utilizes 20k of ram for each player, recording all data
that goes to the screen.  The scroll back buffer allows the player to view
text that has scrolled off the page.

Use of the <pages> is optional.  Without it, the default is the previous
page.  When the user specifies a number, the page displayed will be the amount
of pages back that the player specified.  The actual amount of pages depends on
the amount of text on each page, with the minimum amount of pages stored being
16, up to a nominal maximum of 64 pages.

BUFFER 0 will redisplay the current page.

The size of each page is fixed by the size of the VT100 screen, regardless
whether the player is utilizing VT100.  If the player wishes to change the page
size and is not using VT100, then simply change the VT100 size.

The calculation of amount of lines does not consider lines over 80 characters,
so the PAGER may pause the screen.

                                    Stats
{300}
There are 5 primary attributes for each character:

Strength  Dexterity  Intelligence  Wisdom  Constitution

Type: {168}strength{300}, {168}dexterity{300}, {168}intelligence{300}, {168}wisdom {300}or {168}constitution {300}to
generate a table displaying how these attributes modify your character.

{300}
These commands list some of the modifications that the statistics do to a
character's other stats.  The lists are +/- 4 of your current stat.
~

0 SUICIDE~
{168}
Syntax: SUICIDE <password>
{300}
The suicide command will let you kill yourself.  This will not cost any
experience, but it does cause you to die.  This is useful if you are caught
in a room that is impossible to leave.  After committing suicide, the player
is suggested to visit the morgue to retrieve your items.
~

0 DAMAGE~
{138}
                                   Damage

~

0 DEATH~
{138}
                                    Death
{300}
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back to your death room.  Your
corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed, together with all
of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  If you are first level, the amount you
lose is half-way back to the beginning of your level.  Higher levels take you
back to what you should have had to gain your last level, unless you have the
(KILLER) or (THIEF) flag.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses fall to the ground.
Objects on the ground are quickly picked up by scavenging creatures.
Non-player corpses last about 5 hours of game time (5 minutes of real time).
Player corpses last *roughly* 45 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died can retrieve objects from their corpse.
{168}
Syntax: DEATH
{300}
The death command sets where you will die, or recall reset to.  This can
only be done at specific locations, depending on which god you follow, if any.
The room will say "{168}You feel safe here.{300}" when you may set your death room.

Simply type 'DEATH' in the appropriate room and it is set there.
~

0 KILLER THIEF~
{138}
                              Killers & Thieves
{300}
There are two flags that can show up in the WHO list that mark you as an
unsociable character.  These are (KILLER) and (THIEF).  You may only player
kill or steal if both you and the victim are followers of different gods.

A Killer is someone that used the Murder command to attack another player.  A
player killer (PK) is totally legal, as is player thief (PT), but there are
some serious restrictions on them.  When you are a player killer, the city
guards will all try to kill you on sight (although it is rumored that guards
aren't that quick or perceptive).  Also, when you die, with the PK or PT flag
you not only lose experience back to the start of your current level, but
also all the way back to the start of the previous level.  You will not become
a Killer if the person you try to murder is a Killer.  The flag is removed
on death or over a period of 24 real life hours of game time.

A THIEF is someone that tried to steal from another player and failed.  This
flag will last untill you die.

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP EXP WORTH~
{138}
                             Experience & Levels
{300}
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.
The experience required to gain a level will vary from class to class.

{168}You gain experience by:{300}
    being part of a group that kills a monster
{168}You lose experience by:{300}
    fleeing from combat                 - based on level
    recalling out of combat             - based on level
    dying                               - back to max exp till next level

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; how tough the
mob is; and some random variation.
{168}
Syntax: LEVEL
{300}
The LEVEL command will show your current experience in relation to other
levels of characters in your class.

0 PET PETS~
{138}
                                    Pets

~

0 TICK~
{138}
                                    Tick
{300}
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 60 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.

Area resettings are mainly based on the level of the mobs in it.  They will
vary from 3 to 25 game ticks.

Objects lying on the ground will vanish after 25 game ticks.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet, or
other less obvious background noise.
{168}

~

0 ! .~
{168}
Syntax: .
{300}
'!' or '.' repeats the last command you typed.
{168}
See also: VT100, ALIAS, INTERP.
~

0 GREP ?~
{168}
Syntax: grep <word>
Syntax: ? <word>
{300}
The GREP command, similar to the unix command, searches through the scroll
back buffer and locates lines that contains the <word>.  The system is case
sensative, and finds the last 10 cases.

The '?' command may be used in replace of the word 'GREP'.

This is very useful in showing things like the recent conversation you have
had with another player, and can be found by using the players name for the
word search, though you might find: 'grep replies' to work even better.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
{168}
Syntax: [north, east, south, west, up, down]
{300}
Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
{168}

to be tamed. Once you are the owner of a tamed or bought mountable creature
you can mount and ride it. To stop mounting a creature you can use the
dismount command.
~

0 ENTER~
{168}
Syntax: enter <portal>
{300}
The enter command will allow one to enter a portal, the portal will lead
you and your party to a different location on the mud.
~

0 MOVEMENT~
{138}
                                  Movement
{300}
Movement on the EMud system is based on "Rooms".  Each room is a small area
that all the action takes place in.  Nearly all commands work only inside of
the room you are in.  To move around the realm, use the "north", "south",
"east", "west", "up" and "down" commands.  Movement has a specific delay that
may be changed by using the SPEED command.  Special types of movement involve
using skills or spells, such as RECALL, FLEE, or TELEPORT.  Each of these types
commands has a specific help page for them.

There are several commands that work outside your current room, such as TELL,
SHOUT, GTELL, RCAST, and SHOOT.  These also have specific help pages and
may be a skill, spell, or an ability inherent in every character.
{168}
See also: NORTH, RCAST, SPEED, RECALL.
~

0 CAST~
{168}
Syntax: cast [<percentage>] [']<spell>['] [<target>]
{300}
Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Casting as a multi-class character casts at the level of the spells caster's
class. (Example:  10th level Ranger and 8th level Illusionist would cast
"Burning Hands" as a 8th level caster, not an 18th level caster)

A defensive spell is limited to affecting only those with a level over 60% of
the spell's level.  This means the previous example would limit defensive
spells to characters above 4th level.

Spell strength may be reduced by the addition of a percentage in front of the
spell name.  This effectively reduces the level of the spell cast.  Control of
spell strength is not an exact science, so only expect it's accuracy to be
within about twenty percent.
{168}

~

0 MOVE~
{168}
Syntax: move <skill>
{300}
MOVE, the command, will show you how much movement you will use on a skill
that you can do.
~

0 MANA~
{168}
Syntax: mana <spell>
{300}
Mana is the unit of power that a spell caster uses when spells are cast.  Mana
will decrease with casting, and go up over a period of time.  Some spells or
items may increase a spell caster's mana.  Mana goes up every level for a
spell caster based on wisdom and intelligence.  Mana usage on each spell
decreases based on the level, and the wisdom of the spell caster.

When a spell fails the mana usage is half of normal usage.  If the spell is
successful, but the target of an offensive spell 'saves' then the mana is not
divided by 2.

MANA, the command, will show you how much mana you will use on a spell that
you can cast.  This value will be different for most players, even on the same
spell.
{168}
See also: CAST, RANGECAST, MASS, STATS.
~

0 RANGECAST 'RANGE CAST'~
{168}
Syntax: rangecast <direction> <spell> <target>
{300}
Elementalists can cast their spells at a range of one room away.  It does cost
more mana to range cast than to simply cast.

If you want to cast 'chill touch' to the north at the fido you would type:
 > rangecast n 'chill touch' fido
{168}
See also: help on individual spells, CAST, MANA, MASS.
~

0 POLYMORPH~
{168}
Syntax: polymorph <race>
{300}
Elementalists can change their appearance at will by using their polymorphing
abilities to change their race. The more powerful the druid the more
powerful the races they can turn themself into. The shapeshift does not
last forever, and eventually they will return to their normal shape.
~

0 EXITS~
{168}
Syntax: exits
{300}

{300}
Backstab is the most damaging way to start a fight, used by Marauders.

If you murder someone and have backstab practiced there is a chance that you
will start the fight with a backstab. This chance is based on your percentage
of marauder levels.
~

0 MURDER~
{168}
Syntax: murder <victim>
{300}

murdering someone.  Your target must be above level 25 and must be within a
range of 10 levels.  You can only murder another player if both you and the
victim are followers of one of the gods, and your god is different than your

0 RECALL /~

it will state: You feel very safe here.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

A recall scroll is required to recall, but does not need to be recited.

If you have the word of recall spell you can cast word of recall instead,
and the following options become available:

RECALL SET   will change the destination of the recall to your current room.
RECALL RESET will reset your recall room to your death room.

depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
receive each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.

You may practice skills/spells from other guilds that you were a previous
member of at your current class guild, but for a penalty of 3 practices.

Practice sessions cost a small amount of gold per practice, which goes up
as the character advances in levels.

Syntax: train [amount] <str|int|wis|dex|con|move|mana|hp>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your

initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
less to train your prime and secondary attribute.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practices when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.

Training Move, Mana, and Hp will increase those stats by a small amount.

After every 15 levels your maximum character stat goes up by 1.

                               Quick Overview
{300}
Lowlands is a fantasy AD&D based game in a medieval realm where magic and
strength guide the play of the many people in the game.
The most important thing when first starting is to learn how to use the help
system.  This is described on the following page.
Emud 2.0 has many features that make it stand apart from the base code of diku.

   {168}1) {300}An advanced VT100 interface.
   {168}2) {300}eight character classes and twenty-four character races.
   {168}3) {300}A language based communication system.
   {168}4) {300}Many new skills and abilities.
   {168}5) {300}Ranged skills and spells.

   {168}7) {300}Many new commands and features.
   {168}8) {300}Multi-classing system allowing many combinations of classes.

                                 Using Help
{300}
The help system of Lowlands is fairly detailed and complete.  It is
required that the player has a firm grasp of how the system works before they
play.

To initiate the help system just type "HELP" on the command line.  This will
bring up a menu of all the topics you can choose from.  Simply select the
letter associated with the option, and enter it alone on a line.

Some items are not found in the menu system.  You may locate these by looking
at the Summary listing that is in the menu.  Each individual topic may be
directly indexed by typing "HELP <topic>".  Ex:   "HELP DRINK"

The bottom few lines of most help screens will show a list of further topics
to find information on.  The topics are always related to the one currently
dispayed, and may help the character find a topic that is more specific than
the one that is currently displayed.  There may also be a menu listing.

The HELP system may include statements with a "[" "]" around them.  These
are optional items.  If the statement has a "<" ">" around them, then it is
an argument that must be added to the command.

                                Game Concepts
{300}
Lowlands places the player in the role of a medieval character in a
world filled with magic, combat, and many challenges to overcome.  The world
also has one distinct advantage to other fantasy role-playing type games, in
that the other players can be directly dealt with as if they were part of the
realm.  The game takes no difference, as to whether a person in the game is
a real person, or a computer generated one, although the real ones are
generally much smarter than the computer generated counterparts.

Lowlands is also a game based on real-time, and therefore there is no
way to pause the game, or load a previous position.  Death or victory is
permanent.

The game allows the player to choose from several classes when creating their
character.  The computer will randomly generate the stats for the character.
Although the player may not directly modify any of these stats during creation,
they may re-roll the stats and try for a better set.

                             The City of Chakkor
{300}
Much of game play will take part in the central city of Chakkor.  Since
this is the initial location of the player, after completing Mud School.

The City of Chakkor contains several shops of magic, and also a scattering
of specialty shops that sell everything from arrows to water skins.  All these
shops can be easily used with several special commands that are dedicated to
shop use.  The player may even buy a pet for fun, or as a small assistance in
case they run into anything that wants to eat you.

The City of Chakkor has many historical references placed throughout it's
interior, and the player may find it interesting to just explore around the
city.

Throughout the world a huge network named the Ancient Roads has been built
connecting the areas.  A worldmap is available by using "HELP ROADS".

Beside the Ancient Roads there is a travel company where griffons are used to

Lowlands has several Gods, each of them representing one of the
elements.  If you wish to involve yourself in player killing you must
follow one of the gods.  Think twice before following a God if you are

opponents and likely be killed alot.

{168}1){300}  The ALIAS command can make redefined commands of multiple lines
{168}  {300}  and including arguments inside the alias.
{168}2){300}  The use of the '!' or '.' command repeats the previous command.
{168}3){300}  '.' followed by a letter repeats the last command started with that letter
{168}4){300}  The use of the '&' character will create one line of code that is
{168}  {300}  executed simultaneously.
{168}5){300}  All commands, and names of people, creatures, and objects may be referenced
{168}  {300}  by the first two letters that match with their actual name.

Commands:  The commands that everyone in the game can do.
Skills:    These are commands that only a given class can do.
Socials:   These are commands that anyone can do, but have essentially no
           impact on the game.  They are for inter-player communication.

There are commands to list all the commands, skills, and socials.  These
should be consulted often, until the player has a firm grasp on the majority.

The player may also realize that only a very few are actually required to get
around in the game.  So do not think that not knowing all the commands will
not allow you to play.  Although the more commands that are known, the more
enhanced the player will be while interacting with the virtual game world.

The player may find that he does the same commands repeatedly.  The alias
system may solve many of these problems for the player.

There is also a scroll back buffer for those that do not have that capability
on their local terminals.

Nearly every command has a different format as to how the arguments (the text
after the command name) are layed out.  Some commands have an open format,
like the commands that let you say things in the room.  Some commands have a
highly restrictive format, like the configuration commands.
The use of HELP is required to determine the exact format of each command.

{300}
The skills are commands that are abilities that the character will learn over
time.  If the player becomes one of the four magic casting classes, then they
will learn spells instead of skills.  The spells will require large amounts of
a stat known as MANA.  Classes that are physical based, and use skills, will
require only MOVEMENT.  Each skill or spell can be found using the HELP system.

Although the formats may appear strange at first, the player will readily get
used to them, and not require the use of the HELP system, exept as a reference.

These are commands such as "GRIN" or "LAUGH" that in general do not change
the play of the game.  They do convey a physical or emotional aspect to most
conversations with other players. Without these commands, most conversation
will appear dry, or have that "missing something" feel.  Socials are not found
in the HELP system, and must be tried individually.  There is a command that
lists all of the social commands.

			    The Character:
{300}
The character has several primary components:

   1)  Personalization.        (Character name and title)
   2)  Background of study.    (Character class and race)
   3)  Statistics.             (Character attributes)
   4)  Languages.              (Character knowledge of languages)
   5)  Equipment.              (Equipment found within the game)

Each of these components should be understood and decided upon before character
generation should continue.

                               Personalization
{300}
The format of Lowlands is a fantasy world, so the player may wish to
select a fantasy name.  Although the name must not be the same as another
character, or that of a creature in the game.

To have gotten this far into the instructions, then it is obvious that you
have successfully entered a password.  You may later change your password if
desired.

Characters have two other places where they may enter in a personalized
heading.  They have a title, which shows up in several places immediately after
the character's name.  They also have a description, which can be several
lines, and is displayed when another character looks at them.

Players may wish to use some of the built in commands, such as ALIAS to
modify stock commands to do more personalized things.

                         Background of the Character
{300}
Each player must select one of the eight given classes.  These classes define
what the character will have for a "job" in the fantasy world.  To complement
this, the character will need to choose a race.  The race may actually be
selected during character creation.

The class of a character will define which of the stats should be highest
when deciding on when to keep a character.  The exact nature of what these
stats mean will be understood later in the game, and have little relevancy
here.

Nearly all very low level characters perform about the same regardless of
their class or statistics.  As a character advances, the statistics become
more important.

The race of a character defines who his parents were.  A character may be a
sprite, human, gnome, dwarf, ogre, or other races.  Each of these slightly
modify some of the stats of the character, so in most cases, the final
selection of a good character for a particular class, will end up with a good
choice of race.  Race will effect some commands directly and each race will

                                 Statistics
{300}
Each character has 5 primary attributes, and several other statistics that
change throughout the game.  Each character may want to increase some of these
stats later, and Mud School gives the opportunity to modify some of the stats
immediately.  This lets the player personalize even the stats of the character.

HIT POINTS  (Hp) is an arbitrary number that defines how much damage a
                 character can take, before they die.
MOVEMENT    (Mv) is a number defining the amount of endurance a character has.
MANA        (Mn) is a number defining the magic power a character has.
LEVEL      (Lev) ranks each character against other characters in the game.
EXPERIENCE (Exp) defines how far a player has advanced between each level.
GOLD       (Gld) defines how much money a character has in gold pieces.

You will find things to be sometimes unrealistic, the reason is mosty to
enhance the playability of the game.

STRENGTH     (Str) describes how strong a character is, and affects how hard
                   an opponent is hit.
DEXTERITY    (Dex) is assigned for the quickness of a character and affects
                   how hard the character is to hit by an opponent.
CONSTITUTION (Con) is a factor of the endurance of the character and affects
                   how quick the character recovers, after being hurt.
INTELLIGENCE (Int) describes how much "book knowledge" a character has, and
                   affects a spell's chance to succeed.
WISDOM       (Wis) is a generic stat that describes how well a character
                   advances with each level.

Each of these previous statistics can be temporarily changed by magic.  They
may also be changed permanently by training at one of the several training
halls.

                                  Languages
{300}
Lowlands contains a system that each of the races has their own distinct
language.  Each character starts out with three of these that includes the race
of the character.  The character, when talking to another character, will have
to choose a language to speak in.

Then the receiving party must be able to understand the language that you are
speaking in.  If this is successful, then anything you type in to "say" will
be displayed for them exactly.  It is not necessarily true that both
characters must be speaking in the same language.

As a player advances in level, they will learn more languages.  There are
also a few spells that will enhance the player's ability to communicate.

Nearly all commands that deal with communication use some form of the language
system.  The major exception to this is a system for emergency communications.

In an emergency, the player may sacrifice some experience for talking to
anyone, using: etell

                             Items and Equipment
{300}
The player will notice items on the ground that he wishes to use.  He may also
pick things up immediately from a kill, or buy items in a shop.  Regardless,
the character must transfer the item from his inventory to his equipment.

When a player wears an item, it turns into equipment.  When it is in the
inventory, then it is just carried on the person.  The character must also have
the item in the inventory, not equipment, to drop the item.  There is a special
feature called sacrifice that purges an item from the room.  In this case, the
item must be on the floor.

A player may drop an item, but must be aware that another character may come
along and take it.

Each character has a limit on the amount of weight and items that they may
carry.  These amounts are based on your strength and dexterity.

0 PORT~
{168}
Syntax: port  [<block size>]
{300}
The port command was developed to utilize a small feature of the Internet
that allows small packets to transfer quickly, and large packets to transfer
after a significant lag.  The port command breaks the text sent to the player
into blocks that are user defineable (default 2000).

To minimize lag, reduce this number until lag eases up, but increase it if
response time is too slow.  This system has an optimum value, and lower values
work best for longer distance from the server.  Higher values for close
distances to the server.  There is no 'general' or optimal setting.  The user
will have to try several values within the range.

This system is known to cause VT100 and ANSI systems to lose track of
cursor placement.  To solve this, use the maximum block size.

The range of block size is:    1000   to  10000

The color command both turns on and changes the color fields of the different
parts of the display.  To turn on the color functions, the terminal must support
ANSI colors, and be in VT100 mode.  The vt102 functions must also be activated.
COLOR ON turns on the color modes.

0 CORPSE~
{138}
                                   Corpse
{300}
When a player dies a corpse is created at the spot where he died.  Then the
player awakens naked at their predefined death room shown in score.  They
will have basically no items at all, and must work out a method of recovering
the lost items.

The first place he should check is at the Morgue in the city, where he can
buy back his corpse.  It will show up in the room, where he can retrieve his
items.

When a player gets the items from his corpse, the corpse will instantly decay.
The player that died is the ONLY person in the game that may take items out of
his own corpse.

The game will save your corpse along with the character data, so that if the
game crashes before the player has a chance to get the corpse, it will not
just disappear.  Also the player may quit the game when he dies, because the
corpse will enter the game the same time the player does, even several days
later.  The corpse will ONLY start decaying if the player is on the game.

0 ARENA~

                                  The Arena

The arena is a place where ANYONE may enter to kill anyone else.  There are
no limitations there based on level, god, or how many times you can attack
someone.

Normal hard coded attack rules are non existant in the arena.

You will NOT lose any experience while in the arena.

When you die, you will revive at Chakkor Square.

Players may not RECALL or GOHOME in the Arena.

The player may locate the Arena Sprite for magical assistance, but he will not
help if he finds you.

The player may also be attacked by the Arena Beast, which is always slightly
stronger than the individual that he is attacking.

There are several ways to reference numbers and objects in Lowlands.
The examples that follow use the 'get' command as a reference.

1) Simple:           GET <object name>
   ex:   get arrow          - Gets first arrow.

2) Directed:         GET <item number of object refered to>.<object name>
   ex:   get 2.arrow        - Gets second arrow.

3) All:              GET ALL
   ex:   get all            - Gets everything.

4) All Directed:     GET ALL.<object name>
   ex:   get all.arrow      - Gets all of the arrows, leaving other objects.

5) Counted:          GET <amount> <object name>
   ex:   get 5 arrow        - Gets five of the arrows on the floor.

This system works for most object, mobile related commands.
~

0 REPEAT~
{168}
Syntax: REPEAT <amount> <command string>
Syntax: <amount> <command string>
{300}
The REPEAT command will simply type in the input string for you the amount of
times specified by the amount variable.
This command is limited by the space in the input buffer, which is slightly
over 1200 characters.  Also the command is limited by 2 to 40 repeats.

The REPEAT command need not be typed out, since all command lines that start
with numbers are by default considered a repeat command.

example:  repeat 10 buy recall
  or
example:  10 buy recall
  Both of these would buy 10 recall scrolls, one at a time.

{300}
Lowlands is made up of 9 continents surrounded by oceans. Each continent
contains many separate areas that are linked together by the Roads. Seven of the
continents (aside from the Magic Zone and Iosolo) contain at least one area that
is serviced by Griffon Airlines, allowing for fast and convenient (though
costly) travel between continents.

Additionally, the Roads themselves have direct connections to other areas and it
is possible to walk to many areas. Some are connected directly to others
(requiring you to pass through one to get to the other). In that case, only the
area connected directly to the Roads is shown on the map.

For instance, by typing HELP ROADS, and then typing T for the Toril Continent,
you can view the other areas within that continent.  By looking at the map, you
can see that to get to Tethyr from Waterdeep you would travel south-east and
then west.  Signs posted along the way can be of valuable assistance as well.

                                 Armor Usage
{300}
The following lists the modifiers for armor, or lack thereof, for each Class:
The values are the percent of body covered.  Higher values take into account
that a class has a better ability to use that particular type of armor.

{178}             {178}  Body  Head  Legs  Feet  Arms  Hands  Shield  About
{178}Ranger       {078}   30    20    20    10    15     10      15     20

{178}Illusionist  {078}   30    15    20    10     5      5    none     20
{178}Monk         {078}   30    20    15     5    10      5       5     20
{178}Necromancer  {078}   25    20    20    10    10      5    none     20
{300}
An item with 10% coverage is the same value as the AC of the armor.  Larger
coverage values are multiples of the basic AC of the object, such as an item
worn on the body gives three times the AC that an identify will display.

                                VT100 ON/OFF
{300}
The VT100 command can be turned on and off by the commands:

VT100 ON
VT100 OFF

Simply typing VT100 will give the status of the vt102 system.

The VT100 system modifies all output to your terminal by including information
using vt102 codes.  Vt102 is nearly compatible with vt100, but several commands
might not be implemented in the vt100 system that the VT100 system requires. It
is suggested that all systems run with VT100 on, although it is not necessary.
~

0 VT02~
{138}
                                VT100 Sizing
{300}
The VT100 system allows for terminal sizes of 80 columns only.
The rows, however, may be set with any value in the range of
15 rows to 80 rows.

The VT100 command with a number for an option sets the rows
to that amount.  A refresh of the display is done during this
operation.
~

0 VT03~
{138}
                              VT100 Bold/Nobold
{300}
The VT100 system scans all outgoing data for the word 'You' in any case, and
regardless if it is nested inside another word like 'yourself'.  This intensity
change can be overridden by comands that have defined brightness levels.

This feature is normally on by default, although the user may select to turn
it on or off at any time by issuing the commands:

VT100 BOLD
VT100 NOBOLD

The basic reasoning behind this option is that nearly all lines of text that
the game displays that relate directly to the player contains some form of
the word 'You'.  This means that lines directly relating to the player are
bold, while those that are related to others are dim.
~

0 VT04~
{138}
                               VT100 Slow/Fast
{300}
The VT100 system has the ability to be backward compatible with VT100 systems.
Normally this is not desirable, because the VT100 system operates with less
optimization.  Although it may be required on various operating systems, from
Mac to AIX.  It is suggested that the user try VT100 in fast mode first, and
if any weird display problems crop up, try VT100 in slow mode.

The commands to change the compatibility modes are:

VT100 FAST
VT100 SLOW

{300}
This symptom occurs when the terminal rows are set too low.
Try adjusting the terminal size with 'VT100 <rows>' until only one blank input
line shows up at the bottom of the screen.

The default size is 24 rows, but PCs occasionally use 25, and workstations,
or Windows terminals may use longer screens.

This symptom occurs if your terminal cannot emulate VT100 correctly.  This

use the 'VT100 SLOW' option.
~

0 VTP04~
This system occurs when the HOOK command has been engaged in some
form.  Try turning off all the options on the HOOK command.
This is done by issuing the 'HOOK' command and determining which

followed by the capitalized letter in the HOOK status list.

              How can I change the text from Reverse to Normal
{300}
The method for changing the default characteristics of REVERSE/NORMAL text is
rather convoluted.  It is based of of the COLOR command, and is only allowable
on system that do NOT use color.

Use the 'COLOR ON' command, and change any of the types of text you wish to
make REVERSE by changing the background color to some value besides 0, and
change the forground to 0.

Finially issue the 'COLOR OFF' command to return to normal video mode.

This will allow you to select whether you wish the status bars to be
in reverse video or normal text.

0 AUTO~
{168}
Syntax: AUTO [off/quick/auto]
Syntax: AUTO [<skill/spell name>]
{300}
The AUTO command automates combat in several ways.  AUTO will execute a
command continually until you run out of mana or movement for a particular
skill.  AUTO can always be interupted by typing in a new command.  The WIMPY
command will always override an automatic command.  AUTO will always start
when a player starts combat.

AUTO OFF   - turns off the automatic system.
AUTO AUTO  - turns on the basic automatic system.
AUTO QUICK - turns on the advanced automatic system.

The QUICK mode modifies normal combat, by allowing double speed skills or
spells, at the cost of losing normal attacks.  This is a very good system for
spell casters.
~

0 RELOG~
{168}
Syntax:  RELOG <player name>

Relog allows you to quickly relog as another character. The character must have
the same password as the relogging character.

Finger is a method of summarizing the stats of other players.

The player doesn't need to be in the game to be fingered.
~

0 EMAIL MAIL~
{168}
Syntax:  EMAIL <your email address>
{300}
This command changes the email address listed in the FINGER command.

Though not required we respectfully ask all players to record a proper email
address so we can contact you if needed. To remove your email from the
listing, simply enter an address of '.'
{168}
  example: email chaos@gmail.com
~

0 HTML~
Syntax:  HTML <your web site address>

This information will be included in your finger information, if you wish to
provide it. This information is not checked for validity, so enter at your own
discretion.  If you wish to display a tilde use a '*', which will be converted
into a tilde.  If you would like to remove your web address, simply enter '.'

0 SOCIALCOMMO~
{138}
                                   Socials
{300}
A social is a command that is used to convey an action that is used for
communication, such as 'laugh'.  These commands can be used to convey extra
depth to a statement, and are intended to give a visual clue to the body
language a character would normally use under person-to-person conversation.
Socials can range from funny to vulgar, and can change meaning depending on
the circumstance of the conversation.  Socials follow no set pattern, but
have no real impact on the game.  Socials only work in the same room.

There are three modes of socials:     (examples will use the laugh command)
<social command>                              - Player will simply laugh
<social command> {your name here}             - Player will laugh at himself
<social command> {another person's name here} - Player will laugh at another

To get a complete list of all the socials at any time use the 'SOCIAL' command.

Experiment with another player on what all the socials do, they can get rather
funny. =]

language you are speaking.  The desired player does not need to be in the
same room as you.
~

0 REPLYCOMMO~
{168}

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  Languages do apply to
the say command.  This command may be shortened to the single quote symbol '.
~

0 EMOTECOMMO~
{168}
Syntax:  emote <message>
{300}
Emote is a special form of communication.  It is used to make the others in
your room think you are doing something that you are not.  It is also used to
do some form of social that does not exist.
Emote simply types your character's name followed immediately by the message
that you type.

ex:  emote hits you hard!

Others would see  (if you were named Bilbo ):     Bilbo hits you hard!
~

0 POSECOMMO~
{168}
Syntax:  pose
{300}
This command does a random action based on your character's level and class.
There are several actions that may happen at any time, if used repeatedly.
~

0 SPAM~
{168}
Syntax:  SPAM [< option letter >]
{300}
Spam is a command that turns off certain aspects of combat messages.
It allows those with slow links to have a more timely combat, or just to
filter out undesired combat messages.

SPAM by itself shows a list of the current settings.  It is suggested that the
player try a few of these settings before deciding on any one setup.
The default setting is everything on except the status list.

The status list shows an extra line after each combat round as to the condition
of each of the players in the current player's party.  The data shown is current
and maximum hitpoints.  This may be used by itself as an extra piece of data
with everything else on, or a summary when some of the other statements are
turned off.

Spam used in conjunction with CONFIG can shortened overly long combat rounds
significantly.
~

0 INN~
{138}
                                    Inns
{300}
Inns are special places in the realm, where sleeping is healthy for you.
If you quit in an Inn, you will gain hit points, movement, and mana back
while you are not on the game.  The rate is one point per level of the
character, per hour not on the game.
The room will say "You feel safe to sleep here" when you are in an Inn.
~

0 GUARD~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
The GUARD skill gives you a heightened awareness of the items you have in
your possession, such that you can tell if anyone attemps to steal them.  A
well developed GUARD skill will prevent the majority of all attempted thefts
from your person.  Once this skill is learned, it is always in effect.
~

0 PLANT~
{168}
Syntax: plant <item> <player>
{300}
If you wish to give an item to a player without them realizing you have done
it, then, PLANT is the skill for you!  PLANT allows you to get rid of that
HOT item before the Enforcers get to you.
{168}
See also: STEAL
~

0 CAMP~
{168}
Syntax: camp
{300}
After a long, hard few minutes of taking out large and aggressive monsters,
your party needs to make a CAMP.  When you make a CAMP, you REST or SLEEP
much better.  This enables you to regain your strength (HP,MANA,MOVEMENT)
faster than mere resting on the path will.  Also, while you are camped,
all of the people who are in your group, in your current room, and are either
RESTing or SLEEPing will get the same benefits!

To break CAMP, simply STAND, or have one of your GROUP get attacked...
~

0 'ENERGY SHIFT'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'energy shift' <target> [<value>]
{300}
This spell transfers magical energy in it's truest form to the target.
The ratio of transfered energy is 1 mana for the target for each 2 expended
by the Necromancer.  This value is then compared to the level difference of the
characters.  A Necromancer of 80th level would give 1/10 normal mana to an 8th
level player.  The value is the amount of mana you are willing to transfer.
~

0 ILLUSION~
{168}
Syntax: cast illusion
    or: cast illusion <target>
    or: cast illusion <short description>
{300}
This spell creates a pet of your choice.  Well...at least a pet that looks
like some creature or player or whatever.  The first form of the illusion
spell where you just type "cast illusion" will create a duplicate of yourself
for you to command around.  If you don't want a simulacrum of yourself, you
can make one of ANYONE or ANY CREATURE.  Simply be in a room with the creature
you want to make an illusion of.  For example:
  If you are in a room with "A Beastly Fido", typing:
  >cast illusion fido
  Would create an illusion of the fido that looked exactly like the Fido.
The last form of the illusion spell lets you create your own creature.  Unfor-
tunately, you will only be able to specify a short description of the creature.
Like:
  cast illusion "A Dark and Menacing Beast"
or
  cast illusion "Frank the Illusionist"

NOTE: All illusions will be 3/4 of your current level in the Illusionist guild.
~

0 'WINGED CALL'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'winged call'
{300}
This spell will summon a fairly weak but mountable flying creature.
~

0 BERSERK~
{168}
Syntax: berserk
{300}
This skill allows you to put away all thoughts except raw battle.  When you are
BERSERK, you will hit harder and more often.  You will also be able to channel
your adrenaline in such a way as to give you more stamina.  A side effect of
going BERSERK is that you will not be able to control yourself beyond deciding
where to go and who to KILL or MURDER.

NOTE: Only PURE Rangers have the proper frame of mind to go BERSERK.
~

0 BLOODFRENZY 'BLOOD FRENZY'~
{168}
Syntax: bloodfrenzy
{300}
This skill literally makes your blood boil with rage.  You'll inflict more
damage and posses a greater strength.
~

0 INDUCTION~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'induction' [<value>]
{300}
This spell drains your physical strength to add to your magical strength.
You enter the amount of hit-points you wish to drain and you will gain
one-half that amount of mana.
~

0 RESTORE~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'restore' <target> [<value>]
{300}
This spell uses large quantities of mana to heal large quantities of
hit-points on the target.  The ratio is one-half the hit-points for the mana.
You select how much mana you are willing to spend.
~

0 FORGE~
{168}
Syntax: forge <object name> <new short description>
{300}
This skill lets you take an object and alter it to make it look like something
it isn't.  A lot of the effect is based upon your sheer strength of suggestion,
so the object will eventually revert to its original appearance.  If, for
example, you wanted to make a dagger look like a broadsword you would type:

> forge dagger A long, dark broadsword

Then, you could do with the "broadsword" whatever you could normally do with
the dagger, and everyone would see that you were doing it with a "broadsword."

A failed forge attempt might possibly result in the destruction of the object.
~

0 'DETECT FORGERY'~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Once this skill is learned, it automatically lets you determine if an object
is a forgery.
~

0 'CRITICAL HIT'~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Once this skill is learned, you will be able to render wounds upon your enemy
that will drain him/her of his/her life's blood, slowly, but methodically.  The
wounds will heal over time and with certain "healing" spells.  This skill is an
enhancement of your KNIFE skill.

Even the best users of this skill will not be able to do it continually, but as
the opportunities arise when using his/her KNIFE skill.

It is possible for victims of critical hit to bleed to death after the
Ninja has been vanquished or the victim has somehow escaped the battle.
~

0 'MIRROR IMAGE'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'mirror image' [<name>]
{300}
This spell creates several images of the target player (default target is the
caster).  The images make it harder for the player to be hit during combat.
What happens, is that someone (or something) that attacks the player, will
often actually attack one of the player's images instead.  This destroy's the
image, but does NOT hurt the player.  Only a few magical attacks are fooled
by mirror images, so most offensive spells will automatically attack the actual
player.
~

0 'HALLUCINATE'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'hallucinate' [<name>]
{300}
This COMBAT spell causes the named player to start seeing things.  The player
will no longer be able to tell who's doing something to anything.  They will
be able to see the events happen, but not exactly what the event is that is
happening.  For example, instead of the following line being seen by the
player:
         "Newguy gets a large bow."
The player might see:
         "Order gets a house plant."
~

0 TACTICAL~
{138}
                                  Tactical
{300}
The tactical command allows you to bring up a drop down list of mobiles
that are in the room, with a number specifying the hit/hit_max ratio in
10% increments, with 'F' being Full.  The bold names are those in your group.
There are numbers between the status and name further discussed in Combat Mode.

The tactical display also includes the top stat bar to optimize it's
performance.  This means we have added a few more features to it.
The first is a game clock, which relates time in the realm.
The second is a single letter for your current speed.

A larger display should not change transmission rate, so use the largest you
can stand.

The TACTICAL command allows you to change the size of the tactical map, with
the value '1' turning off the Tactical display.  The maximum size of the
tactical depends on your terminal display size.  The absolute maximum is 19.

0 TACT03~
{138}
                                 Combat Mode
{300}
Each character and creature has a distinct index assigned to them.  For players
this means that your assigned number will never change.  For creatures, it
means that it will change for each new creature created when areas reset.
These numbers can be used to distinguish individual creatures of the same kind.

The numbers only show the last two digits, so repeating is possible, but fairly
slim chances.  These numbers normally appear between the health status and the
name of the character.

When in combat, a fighting character will display the '>' symbol followed by
another index number.  This means that thar particular character is fighting
the pointed to character.

The tactical numbers may be toggled on and off using the 'TACTICAL N' command.

The TACTICAL INDEX command allows you to change your designator from the
default number.
~

0 TACT04~
{168}
Syntax:  TACTICAL INDEX <two letter index>
{300}
The tactical index allows the player to choose 2 letters, numbers, or symbols
to replace the default value given by the tactical system.
~

0 COMPASS~
{138}
                                   Compass
{300}
The Compass that is integrated into the Tactical map has several options.
The Compass has two sizes depending on how large your Tactical map is.

To change the width of the compass, type:
TACTICAL COMPASS <Direction Name Width>
This will change the length in characters of the words in the Compass.
The possible values for widths are:
0           :   Turns off Compass.
4 through 16:   Turns on Compass with specified widths on words.

The names of rooms have special colors that show what terrain type the room is.
To get a complete list of these types, simply type 'TACTICAL COMPASS' without
a number.

The Compass may slow down your system a bit, but it's great for exploring.

When using the compass, it is suggested to turn the AUTO_EXIT in the CONFIG
command off.

~

0 TACT02~
{138}
                              Future additions
{300}
Over-view of the room showing player and mobile arrangements during
combat.  This will allow a 'chess-like' feature to the game.

~

0 TACT05~
{168}
Syntax:  TACTICAL TOP
Syntax:  TACITCAL BOTTOM
{300}
This command modifies the look to the tactical display.  It moves the top
status bar either to the very top of the screen, or the bottom line of the
tactical display.  This command only affects the upper portion of the display.
It may be of value to shift the tactical to the bottom for clarity.
~

0 DISPLAY~
{168}
Syntax: DISPLAY <object or mobile name>
{300}
This command works similar to looking at an object, but sends a picture
of the object instead.  This system is set up for objects and mobiles that
have defined displayable pictures.

Looking at an object normally will say if the object has a displayable
picture.

This mode requires that the system be a IBM-PC system with a color terminal.
Any other system that has the ascii character 220 ( a half solid block ) will
also work.

The displayed image is 78 by 40 pixels with 8 colors.
This is the first bitmap graphics format for Emud, and is fairly basic.
There are also very few objects or mobiles that incorporate this feature.

This command incorporates special features when working with MrTerm.  Notably
a much higher transfer rate.

0 MAP~
{168}
Syntax: MAP [<range>]
{300}
The map command works with the range system to give you a view or the
surrounding rooms.  It shows all open exits at each room.  The colors
represent the sector type, the same as the tactical compass.  Without a
specificed range, the map is shown at it's maximum size, but the text size is
reduced.  The range value can limit it to a shorter, but clearer, view.
{168}
See also: ROADS, ARENA, OBELISK.
~

0 REINCARNATE~
{168}
Syntax: REINCARNATE <class> <race> <sex> <password>
{300}
The reincarnate system is designed to give players near-unlimited play length.
Essentially, it allows a maxed level player (95th) to start the character over
again.  With each successive generation of reincarnations, the game setting
gets increasingly harder, but gives out larger gains.

When reincarnating stats are rerolled, similar to the character generation
system, when someone first starts playing.  The reincarnate command may be
executed successively, until the desired stats are found.

The reincarnate command may not be issued after the character gains even one
experience point, when rerolling stats, although a 95th level character may
select to reincarnate at any time.

The reincarnated character will lose all gold, items, and skills/spells.
But they will retain their castle.  The hours played will be maintained,
but the age will reflect the correct value for the new character.  The
amount of reincarnations a character has been through can be seen in the
FINGER command.

There are only three places where reincarnation numerically affects the new
character, bonuses when gaining a level, amount of experience earned for a
kill and the maximum statistics.  With each successive reincarnation, bonuses
per level will increase with: 8 hp, 6 mana, 5 move and 3 practises.  With each
successive reincarnation the amount of experience gained for a kill is lowered
by 1/3rd and 1 point is added to each statistic.
~

0 PROMPT~
{168}
Syntax: prompt [<arguments>]
{300}
The PROMPT command is used to reconfigure the prompt display for players that
do not use the tactical information, or cannot use the VT100 support.
The player would simply give an argument of various terms.  These terms would
be directly displayed on the prompt.  The player may also determine what kinds
of information they are to receive.  To add a variable, the user would place
a '$' symbol followed by a key character that represents what the variable is.

  Key fields:  '$h'  Current Hit Points      '$H'  Maximum Hit Points
               '$v'  Current Movement        '$V'  Maximum Movement
               '$m'  Current Mana            '$M'  Maximum Mana

0 DUMP~
{168}
Syntax: dump
Syntax: dump buffer
{300}

display something stored in a clipboard, or other transfer system.  Simply
issue the DUMP command and any following lines are 'said' without having to
specify a command in front of the individual 'says'.  The character will
continue to 'dump' statements into the room until the STOP command is issued.

If you have something of importance in your BUFFER an immortal should know
about you have the ability to dump your buffer. This way an immortal can
look at the buffer, this comes in helpful if some weird game error occurs
that is otherwise hard to explain.

If you dump your buffer twice, the first buffer dump will be over written.

strength of creatures and characters.  This spell is so powerful that it may
only be cast once on any creature during a fixed amount of time.  If the spell

casting time, but costs a significant amount of mana.

0 CLIMB~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Climb skill is the ability to climb rocky terrain that a character may fall
from.  Falling from terrain may be deadly.  Climbing skill is a significant
benefit to traversing this type of terrain, as it is usually windy so that any
flying spell serves no value.  Normal characters must rely on their dexterity

the practice and training of the climb skill.

~

0 CONFUSION~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'confusion' <target>
{300}

and attack the handiest body available.  This may be another party member, or
some innocent creature that just happens to be wandering through.  Confusion
is only partially effective as a means to divert attacks, yet is quite handy
against a group of creatures, with few on the casting side, as odds should
point out that there are more bodies to attack on the victim's side.
~

0 'MAKE POISON' MAKEPOISON~
{168}
Syntax:  makepoison <type> <color> <object>
{300}
The Make Poison skill allows a Ninja to put together a batch of various
types of materials, and brew up a very vile poison.  This poison may be placed
upon weapons, ammo, food and drink.  This is quite possibly one of the nastiest
of all abilities in the Realm.

  TYPE is either 'CLEAR' for players or 'MURKY' for mobiles.

  COLOR is one of:
      BLUE   - Slow duration poison of strong strength.
      GREEN  - Combination instant and slow duration.
      PURPLE - Instant damage without duration.

  OBJECT is the object that the poison is being placed upon.

This skill is not only hazardous to make use of, but also the final use of
the poison is hazardous.  If the Ninja fails in the task of creating the
poison, it ends up affecting the Ninja immediately.  Only the Ninja may
see and use the poison weapons that they have created.  Since each Ninja is
unique, this applies to other Ninjas as well.  Poisons applied to ammo will
affect the victim at approximately one-half normal damage.  Each object may
have only one dosage, yet a creature or player may be affected by numerous
poisons.  Mismatching the TYPE of poison will cause one-half damage.

If a Ninja manages to kill a player with poison, he will be credited
with a kill as normal. A smart player will not accept weapons, food, or
generally anything from Ninjas, as they may have a bit of vile poison
accidently boobie-trapping the innocent player.

{300}
Custom color may be added to certain strings.  Player descriptions and Clan
descriptions may all have custom color.  Adding color is as simple as adding

numbers are the parameters of the color change request.

Format:    '{abc}'           with a, b, c being parameters.

    Parameter 'a':  VT100 code.
                       0 - Dim
                       1 - Bold
                       3 - Text default (ignores b/c parameters)

This example starts with normal colors.  'dog' is bold, yellow on black.
