At level twenty and above one is allowed to join a guild.  Once you have
joined a guild you cannot leave it or join another one.  Each guild offers
new and exciting options for the players, but a lot is expected of those
that decide to join.

   |{068}   The adventurer's guild is the easiest of the specialized guilds.   {078}|
   |{068}         The requirement is merely to be level 20 or higher.          {078}|
   |{068}  Once you join, you'll be able to obtain 75 tokens hidden throughout {078}|
   |{068}     the realm.  You can take the tokens to the main office of the    {078}|
   |{068}        guild and get a chance to spin the wheel of adventure.        {078}|
   |{068}  The drawback is:  Once you find all 75 tokens, you can't get more.  {078}|

   |{068}          The survivalist's guild is a more difficult guild.          {078}|
   |{068}               To join, you must be level 25 or higher.               {078}|
   |{068}   Being a survivalist, you don't care very much for the comforts of  {078}|
   |{068}    a nice bed, or a hot meal.  You like to live in the wilderness,   {078}|
   |{068}  and live off the land.  Everything you need to survive you can find {078}|
   |{068}   outdoors, whether it be food, water, or herbs for healing salves.  {078}|

   |{068}      The league of the white rose is a very restricting guild.       {078}|
   |{068}     To join, you must have at least 30 levels in the shaman class.   {078}|
   |{068}   As a healer, you care for others more than yourself.  And to you,  {078}|
   |{068}  being good to your fellow man ensures greater rewards when you die. {078}|
   |{068}   Therefore, you steer away from evil, and concentrate on the good   {078}|
   |{068}     around you.  Joining the guild gives you help in this task.      {078}|

   |{068}   This guild is for casters, for the most part.  To join, you must   {078}|
   |{068}      have at least 30 levels in the druid, sorcerer or warlock       {078}|
   |{068}                    classes, and you must be evil.                    {078}|
   |{068}  Being part of the circle allows you to let out your innermost evil  {078}|
   |{068}   thoughts and temptations, and wreak havoc on anything good.  Once  {078}|
   |{068} you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. {078}|
   |{068}   But joining this guild gives you an added bonus, if you use it.    {078}|

   |{068}    The psionicist's guild is probably the most powerful of all the   {078}|
   |{068}             guilds, due to the nature of their abilities.            {078}|
   |{068}                      To join, you must be level 65.                  {078}|
   |{068}  Once you enter the guild, you are trained to use your mind to cause {078}|
   |{068}  all sorts of unusual things to happen.  Accidents can cause serious {078}|
   |{068}  damage to your being though, which is why the minimum level is 65.  {078}|
   |{068}  Your psionic ability is measured in psi-points, like magic is with  {078}|
   |{068}         mana.  Some skills use more psi-points than others.          {078}|

   |{068}    This guild allows you to accept contracts from players of the     {078}|
   |{068}     realm.  Once a player issues his contract to the guild, any      {078}|
   |{068}   hitman can attempt to fulfil that contract.  The first to do so    {078}|
   |{068}    will receive the posted reward.  No other players can see the     {078}|
   |{068}   contracts.  Only ninjas and marauders can join this guild.  The    {078}|
   |{068} longer a player stays in the order, the better.  For eventually one  {078}|
   |{068}            will forge their own powerful, jagged knife.              {078}|

Gisbourne looks up as you enter.~
He is long and lean, with the look of a sleek wolf.  He has dark brown eyes,
sharp with intelligence, and dark brown hair, parted in the middle and falling
to his shoulders.  He wears a dark goatee, closely trimmed, and richly
embroidered clothes cover his spare frame.

Entrance to the Guild Halls~
This huge stone entrance leads the way to the Guilds that flourish upon the
lands. If one joins a guild they increase their effectivness and strength as
they wander about.  Be wary and choose carefully as some of the Guilds do have
some drawbacks, but still they are a great experience and prove to add to each
character.

Adventurer's Guild Briefing Room~
The adventurer's guild is a guild for those who wish to explore the depths
of the realm, where players seldom venture.  In return, the adventurer will
occasionally be rewarded with a "token" for his troubles.  Throughout the
realm there are 75 creatures with tokens.  Each token gives the adventurer
a chance to spin the wheel of adventure.  Of course, once you gain all 75
tokens, you cannot gain any more.

Survivalist's Guild Briefing Room~
Survivalists believes that everything they will ever need can be found in
nature.  Whether it be water, food, medicine, or whatever.  Therefore, they
try to avoid the indoor comforts, and live off the land.  Joining the guild
gives you the necessary skills to find food, water, and to create healing
salves.  However, you won't like being inside for any length of time.

League of the White Rose Briefing Room~
The league of the white rose is a guild that provides help to the patrons of
the realm.  When joining the league, you'll be able to call for help from a
holy servant.  The servant will obey your commands, and provide assistance to
you or your comrades when needed, but the servant's duration is limited, as
it must leave its plane of existence to enter yours.  If you turn to an evil
alignment, then you will be zapped by the ring until you return to neutral or
good alignment.

Have you ever wanted to just lash out with all your destructive energies and
bring death and disease upon your fellow players?  If so, you're evil! Of
course, to join the Circle, you need to be evil, so that's a good thing.  Once
a member, you will be able to call upon a winged creature from the depths of
hell to assist in your destructive actions.  If you ever change to a good
alignment, you will be zapped until you become evil again.

Psionicist's Guild Briefing Room~
The psionicist's guild is possibly the most powerful guild.  New skills are
acquired, and can be used by expending psi-points, similar to using mana when
casting spells.  Since a psionicist's source of power comes from the mind,
there is really no way to counterract the skills, but if something goes wrong,
the damage taken can be severe.

The order of the jagged knife, being a pure assassin guild, is simply an
addition to the skills of the assassin class.  The trick to this guild is that
the longer you stay in it, the better the weapon you will eventually forge.
